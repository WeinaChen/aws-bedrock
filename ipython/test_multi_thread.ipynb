Feedback on the public consultation  34FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n3 \\n \\n1. Executive summary  \\nThe c omplexity of information and communication technology ( ICT) and security risks is increasing \\nand the frequency of ICT and security -related incidents (including cyber incidents) is rising , together \\nwith their potential significant adverse impact  on financial institutions ’ operational functioning. \\nMoreover, due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions , ICT and security -relate d \\nincidents risk causing potential systemic impact s. The EBA has responded to this by detailing how \\nsupervisors should cover ICT and security risk s within supervision (EBA/GL/2017/05), by detailing \\nhow financial institutions should manage outsourcing (EBA/ GL/2019/02) and by describing the \\nexpectation s for ICT and security risk management for the financial institutions in these guidelines . \\nThese guidelines set out how financial institutions  should manage the ICT and security risk s that \\nthey are exposed to. In addition, this guidance aims to provide the financial institutions to which \\nthe guidelines apply  with a better understanding of supervisory expectations for the management \\nof ICT and security risk s. \\nThese guidelines integrate  and are built on the requirements set out in the ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures for operational and security risks of payment services ’ (hereafter ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures ’), which were published in December 2017 (EBA /GL/2017/17) and which have appl ied \\nsince January 2018 in fulfilment of the mandate in Article  95(3) of Directive  2015/2366/EU (PSD2) . \\nThose guidelines were addressed to payment service providers (PSPs ), and only applied to their \\npayment services ; however , they were  in fact relevant to a broader set of institutions. For that \\nreason, these guidelines have been formulated to be addressed to a broader range of financial \\ninstitutions  under the EBA ’s remit  (namely to credit institutions wh ich already fell within  the scope \\nof the guidelines  on security measures for their payment services , but for wh ich these guidelines \\nwill now apply for all activities) and to investment firms.  These guidelines continue to apply to PSPs \\nfor the payment services they provide ; they extend to other activities o f credit institutions and also \\napply to investment firms for all activities.  Collectively, the guidelines apply to financial institutions \\nas set out in paragraph  9 under the addressees section.  \\nThe term ‘ICT and security risk s’ addresses  the operational an d security risks mandate of Article  95 \\nof the r evised Payments Services Directive (PSD2 ). This term recognises that the operational risks \\nfor payment services refer predominantly to ICT and security risk s because of the electronic nature \\nof payment services  (over ICT systems).  For this reason, these guidelines refer to ‘ICT and security \\nrisk’ instead of ‘operational and security risk’ to avoid confusion with wider operational risk issues , \\nsuch as  conduct risk, legal risk and reputational risk. Furthe rmore, security risks may stem from \\ninadequate or failed internal processes or exter nal events , but ultimately it is their  impact on \\nsystems and data that is relevant. The definition of ‘ICT and security risk ’ is based on the definition \\nin the EBA Guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory \\nreview and evaluation process and supervisory stress testing (EBA /GL/2018/03) ; thus , it \\nencompasses data integrity risk but includes additional details to clarify that it covers the impact \\nderiving from security risks.FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n4 \\n \\nThese guidelines provide detail s on how financial institutions should comply  in order  to address ICT \\nand security risk s, with the following  provisions in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD ) and \\nPSD2: \\n(i) Article  74 of Directive  2013/36/EU (CRD) , which strengthens the governance requirements for \\ninstitutions , including the requirements to have robust governance arrangements with a clear \\norganisational structure with well -defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility and  \\neffective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the risk they are or might be exposed \\nto;  \\n(ii) Article  95 of Directive  2015/2366/EU (PSD2) , which contains explicit provisions for the \\nmanagement of operation and secu rity risks that requir e PSPs to have appropriate mitigation \\nmeasures and control mechanisms to manage the operational and security risks and includes a \\nmandate for the EBA to develop guidelines on this topic.  \\nThese guidelines specify the above -mentioned requirements as follows:  \\nSection  3.1 sets out the proportionate application of these guidelines , recognising the potential \\nvariation in size , complexity , inter nal organisation, nature, scope  and riskiness of the servic es and \\nproducts between financial institutions . \\nSection  3.2 of the guidelines focuses on the management and mitigation of ICT and security risk s \\nthrough establishing sound internal governance and an internal control framework that sets clear \\nresponsibiliti es for financial institutions ’ staff , including for the management bodies. It requires the \\nestablishment of the financial institutions’ ICT strategy, which should be aligned with their overall \\nbusiness strategy. The guidelines also remind financial institutions  to ensure the effectiveness of \\nthe risk -mitigating measures, as defined by their risk management framework, when outsourcing \\nor using third party providers. This should be set out in contracts and service  level agreements. \\nNevertheless, financ ial institutions  should monitor and seek assurance of the level of compliance.  \\nSection  3.3 requires financial institution s to manage and mitigate  ICT and security risks through an \\nindependent and objective control function, appropriately segregated from IC T operations \\nprocesses and not responsible for any internal audit, and  an independent internal audit function.  It \\nrequires financial institutions  to maintain up dated  mapping  of their business functions, supporting \\nprocesses and information assets  and to classify them in terms of criticality, based on the \\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Based on this, financial institutions should assess \\nthe operational risks related to ICT and the security risk s that impact them  and should determine \\nwhat measures are required to mitigate the identified risks.  \\nSection  3.4 sets out requirements for information security to the extent that the information is held \\non ICT systems. This section defines requirements to implement effective information security \\nmeasures, including having an information security policy in place ; establishing, implementing and \\ntesting information security measures; and establishing a training programme for all staff  and \\ncontractors . \\nSection  3.5 specif ies high -level principles on how ICT operations should be managed, including \\nrequirements to improve , when possible , the efficiency of ICT operations ; implement logging and \\nmonitoring procedures for critical ICT operations ; maintain an upFINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n5 \\n \\n-to-date inventory of their ICT assets ; monitor and manage the life  cycle of ICT assets ; and \\nimplement data and ICT systems backup and re storation procedures. Financial institutions  should \\nalso establish and implement incident and problem management process es. \\nSection  3.6 describes r equirements for ICT project and change management, including the \\nacquisition, development and maintenance of ICT systems and services. Financial institutions  \\nshould ensure that changes to production systems are assessed, tested, approved and \\nimplemented in  a controlled  manner, with the aim of ensuring that ICT projects have appropriate \\ngovernance and oversight and that the development of applications is carefully monitored from the \\ntest phase to the production phase.  \\nSection  3.7 specifies expectations with regard to business continuity management and developing \\nresponse and recovery plans, including testing, and their consequent updat ing based on the test \\nresults. Financial institutions  should ensure that they have effective crisis communication measures \\nin place so that all relevant internal and external stakeholders can be informed in a timely manner. \\nThe ICT business continuity management processes are an integral part of the overall financial \\ninstitution ’s business continuity management process and should not be separated.  \\nThe last section , Section  3.8, applies only to PSPs  for their provision of payment services . It \\nprescribes requirements for payment service users (PSUs) relationshi p management, including \\nallowing PSUs to disable specific payment functionalities (where product functionality permits), \\nreceiving alerts on initiated and/or failed attempts to initiate payment transactions, and providing \\nPSUs with assistance on questions and requests for support.  The EBA stresses the importance of \\nensuring transparency, such that PSUs are always aware of which PSP is responsible for providing \\nthem with the payment service.  \\nIn implementing these guidelines , financial institutions  should refer to existing standards and \\nleading best practices.  These guidelines intend to be technology and methodology agnostic.  \\nThe implementation of these guidelines should be done in accordance with the principle of \\nproportionality , taking into accoun t the scale and complexity of operations, the nature of the \\nactivity engaged in, the types of services provided and the corresponding ICT and security risk s \\nrelated to financial  institutions ’ processes and services.  \\nThese guidelines complement and should b e read in conjunction with the supervisory assessment \\nto the applicable institutions in the EBA Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the Supervisory \\nReview and Evaluation Process (EBA /GL/2017 /05), which are addressed to supervisors , as well as \\nother rel evant guidelines such as  the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements \\n(EBA/GL/2019 /02). \\nNext steps  \\nThe EBA Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services \\nunder Directive (EU)  2015/2366 (PSD2) will be repealed after the se guidelines come into force.FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n2. Background and rationale  \\n1. ICT risks can pose significant adverse prudential risks , potentially compromising a financial \\ninstitution ’s viability. For this reason, ICT and security risk  management is fundamental for a \\nfinancial institution to achieve its strategic, corporate, operational and reputational objectives.  \\n2. The scope of application of the guidelines covers PSPs  for their payment services  (any reference \\nto ‘payment services ’ includes ‘issuing of electronic money ’), credit institutions for all activities \\nbeyond their payment services  and also investment firms  for all activities . Specifically, t hese \\nguidelines are addressed to (1) PSPs as defined in Article  4(11) of PSD2 ; (2) to ins titutions, \\nmeaning credit institutions and investment firms as defined in point  3 of Article  4(1) of \\nRegulation (EU)  No 575/2013 ; and ( 3) to competent authorities , as defined in point  40 of \\nArticle  4(1) of Regulation (EU)  No 575/2013, including the European Central Bank with regard to \\nmatters relating to the tasks conferred on it by Regulation (EU)  No 1024/2013, and to competent \\nauthorities under PSD2, as referred to in point  (i) of Article  4(2) of Regulation \\n(EU)  No 1093/2010.  For the purpose of the se guidelines, unless specified otherwise, the \\naddressees in points  1 and 2 above are collectively referred to as ‘financial institutions ’. \\n3. These guidelines integrate the ‘Guidelines on security measures for operational and security \\nrisks of payment servic es’ under Article  95 of PSD2 , which were published in December 2017 \\n(EBA /GL/2017/17) , and elaborate further on certain topics that contribute to mitigating ICT and \\nsecurity risk s in financial  institutions . These guidelines therefore contribute to a level  playing \\nfield for all financial  institutions . The guidelines also address the European Commission ( the \\nCommission ) request set out in the Commission’s  financial technology ( FinTech ) action plan \\npublished in March 2018 , which requests that European Supervis ory Authorities develop \\nguidelines on ICT risk management and mitigation requirements in the EU financial sector1. \\n4. The guidelines address ICT and security risks  that have increased in recent years. This is d ue to \\nthe increasing digitalisation of the financial sector and the increasing interconnectedness \\nthrough telecommunications channels (internet, mobile and wireless lines, and wide area \\nnetworks) and with other financial institutions and third parties . This render s financial  \\ninstitutions ’ operations vulnerable to external security attacks , including cyber -attacks ; \\ntherefore, recognising the need for preparedness for cybersecurity, th ese guidelines implicitly \\ncover the need for cybersecurity  within the financi al institution ’s information security measures . \\nWhil e these guidelines recognise that cybersecurity should be undertaken as part of a  financial  \\ninstitution ’s overall information security risk management , it is worthw hile pointing out that  \\n                                                                                                          \\n1 European Commission ’s FinTech action plan — https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -\\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0109  — Box 8, point  2.FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n7 \\n \\ncyber -attacks  have some specific characteristics  that should be taken into account  in ensuring \\nthat the information security measures are adequate to mitigate cyber risks : \\ni) Unlike most other sources of risk, malicious cyber -attacks are often difficult to identify \\nor ful ly eradicate , and the breadth of damage is difficult to determine . \\nii) Some cyber -attacks can render common risk management and business continuity \\narrangements ineffective (e.g. disaster recovery procedure s), and they might in some \\ninstances fuel the spread  of malware and corrupted data to backup systems . \\niii) Third party service providers, vendors and vendors ’ products may become channel s to \\npropagate cyber -attacks ; therefore , an interconnected financial institution that has  \\nindividual low relevance may become vul nerable and a source of risk propagation. \\nObserving the weakest link principle , cybersecurity should not only be a concern for \\nmajor market participants and critical service providers.  \\n5. The guidelines are compatible with the three lines of defence model, with the ICT operational \\nunits being the f irst line of defence. T he guidelines focus in particular on the responsibilities of \\nthe management body and the second line of defence ( which usually includes the information \\nsecurity function ), and, following the public consultation, the structure of the guidelines has \\nbeen revised to better reflect this focus.  It is further clarified that cross -references  to the EBA \\nGuidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11) are intend ed to incorporate in these \\nguidelines  governance requirements that are (objectively) valid for the purposes of these \\nguidelines . For the avoidance of doubt,  references do not change or expand the scope of \\napplication of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance . \\n6. The provisions of the ‘Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of \\npayment services ’ (EBA/GL/2017/17) have been transposed and incorporated into these \\nguidelines, with a wording that has been adapted to fit with the wider scope of addressees and \\nwith other provisions. As it was the case for the ‘Guidelines on the security measures for \\noperational and security risks of payment services ’, these guidelines should be applied in a \\nmanner that is proportionate to the nature, scope  and complexity of the PSP s’ and institutions ’ \\nbusiness es and the corresponding ICT and security risk s. The ‘Guidelines on the security \\nmeasures for operational and security risks of payment services ’ (EBA/GL/2017/17) will \\ntherefore be repealed with effect from the date of applicat ion of these guidelines, which replace \\nthem in their entirety.FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\n3.

Competent authorities as defined in Article  4(2) of Regulation (EU)  No 1093/2010 and to \\nwhom guidelines apply should com ply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate \\n(e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where \\nguidelines are directed primarily at institutions.  \\nReporting requirements  \\n3. According to Article  16(3) of R egulation (EU)  No 1093/2010, c ompetent authorities must notify \\nthe EBA whether  they comply or intend to comply with these guidelines, or otherwise , with \\nreasons for non -compliance, by 04/05/2020 . In the absence of any notification by this deadline, \\ncompetent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non -compliant. Notifications should \\nbe sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website to compliance@eba.europa.eu  \\nwith the reference ‘EBA/GL/ 2019 /04’. Notifications should be submitted by persons with \\nappropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities.

These guidelines build on the provisions of Article  74 of Directive  2013/36/EU (CRD) regarding \\ninternal governance , and derive from the mandate to issue guidelines in Article  95(3) of \\nDirective (EU)  2015/2366 (PSD2).  \\n6. These guidelines specify the risk management measures that financial institutions (as defined \\nin paragraph  9 below) must take in accordance with Article  74 of the CRD to manage their ICT \\nand security risk s for all activities and that payment service providers  (PSPs  as defined in \\nparagraph  9 below ) must take, in accordance with Article  95(1) of PSD2 , to manage the \\noperational and security risks (intended as ‘ICT and security risk s’) relating to the payment \\nservices they provide. The guidelines include requirements for information security, including \\ncybersecurity, to the extent that the information is held on ICT s ystems.  \\nScope of application  \\n7. These guidelines apply in relation to  the management of ICT and security risk s within financial \\ninstitutions (as defined in paragraph  9). For the purposes of these guidelines, the term ICT and \\nsecurity risk s address es the operational and security risks  of Article  95 of PSD2 for the provision \\nof payment services . \\n8. For PSPs (as defined in paragraph  9) these guidelines apply to their provision of payment \\nservices, in line with the scope and mandate of Article  95 of PSD2. For institutions  (as defined \\nin paragraph  9) these guidelines apply to all the activities  that they provide . \\nAddressees  \\n9.

Proportionality  \\n1. All financial  institutions  should comply with the provisions set out in these guidelines  in such a \\nway that is proportionate to, and takes account of, the financial  institutions ’ size, their internal \\norganisation,  and the nature, scope, complexity and riskiness of the services and products that \\nthe financial institutions  provide or intend to provide.  \\n \\n3.2. Governance and strategy  \\n3.2.1.  Governance  \\n2. The management body should ensure that financial  institutions  have adequate internal \\ngovernance and internal control framework in place for their ICT and security risk s. The \\nmanagement body should set clear  roles and responsibilities for ICT functions , information \\nsecurity risk management, and business continuity, including those for the management body \\nand its committees.  \\n3. The management body should ensure that the quantity and skills of financial  institutions ’ staff \\nis adequate to support  their  ICT operational needs  and their  ICT and security risk  management \\nprocess es on an ongoing basis  and to ensure the implementation of their  ICT strategy . The \\nmanagement body should ensure that the allocated budget is appropriate to fulfil the above.  \\nFurthermore, financial institutions  should ensure that all staff members , including key function \\nholders , receive appropriate training  on ICT and security risk s, including on information \\nsecurity , on an annual basis, or more frequently if required  (see also Section  3.4.7). \\n4. The management body has overall accountability for setting, approving and overseeing the \\nimplementation of financial  institutions ’ ICT strategy as part of their overall business strateg y \\nas well as for the establishment of an effective risk management framework for ICT and security \\nrisks. \\n3.2.2.  Strategy  \\n5. The ICT strategy should be aligned with financial institutions ’ overall business strategy and \\nshould define:  \\na) how financial institutions ’ ICT should evolve to effectively support and participate in \\ntheir  business strategy, including the evolution of the organisational structure, ICT \\nsystem changes and key dependencies with third parties;  \\nb) the planned strategy and evolution of the architecture of ICT, including third party \\ndependencies;FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 15 \\nc) clear information security  objectives , focusing on ICT systems and ICT service s, staff \\nand processes.  \\n \\n6. Financial institutions  should establish set s of action plans  that contain measures to be taken to \\nachieve the objective of the ICT strategy . These should be communicated to all relevant staff \\n(including contractors and third party providers where applicable and relevant). The action \\nplans should be periodically reviewed to ensure their relevance and appropriateness.  Financial  \\ninstitutions  should also establish  process es to monitor and measure the effectiv eness of  the \\nimplementation of the ir ICT strategy . \\n3.2.3.  Use of third party providers  \\n7. Without prejudice to the  EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements  (EBA /GL/2019/ 02) and \\nArticle  19 of PSD2 , financial  institutions  should ensure the effectiveness of the risk -mitigating \\nmeasures as defined by their risk management framework , including the measures set out in \\nthese guidelines , when operational functions of payment services and/or ICT services and ICT \\nsystems  of any activity  are outsourced , including to group  entities, or when using third parties . \\n8. To ensure continuity of ICT services and ICT systems , financial institutions should ensure that \\ncontracts  and service level agreements (both for norma l circumstances as well as in the event \\nof service disruption — see also Section  3.7.2) with  provider s (outsourcing provider s, group  \\nentit ies, or third part y provider s) include the following:  \\na) appropriate and proportionate information security -related objectives and measures \\nincluding requirements such as minimum cybersecur ity requirements ; specifications of \\nthe financial institution ’s data life cycle ; any requirements regarding data encryption , \\nnetwork security and security monitoring processes , and  the location of data centres ;  \\nb) operational and security incident handling p rocedures including  escalation and \\nreporting.  \\n9. Financial institutions should monitor and seek assurance on the level of compliance of these \\nproviders with  the security objectives, measures and performance targets  of the financial \\ninstitution . \\n3.3. ICT and security risk  management framework  \\n3.3.1.  Organisation and objectives  \\n10. Financial institutions  should identify and manage their ICT and security risk s. The ICT function(s) \\nin charge of ICT systems, processes and security operations should have appropriate processes \\nand controls in place to ensure that all risks are identified, analysed, measured, monitored, \\nmanaged, reported and kept within the limits of the financial institution ’s risk appetite and that \\nthe projects and systems they deliver and the activities they perform are in compliance with \\nexternal and internal requirements.  \\n11. Financial institutions should assign the responsibility for managing and ove rseeing ICT and \\nsecurity risks to a control function, adhering to the requirements of Section  19 of the EBA \\nGuidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11) . Financial institutions should ensure theFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 16 \\nindependence and objectivity of this control function b y appropriately segregating it from ICT \\noperations processes. This control function should be directly accountable to the management \\nbody and responsible for monitoring and controlling adherence to the ICT and security risk \\nmanagement framework. It should ensure that ICT and security risks are identified, measured, \\nassessed, managed, monitored and reported. Financial institutions should ensure that this \\ncontrol function is not responsible for any internal audit.  \\nThe i nternal audit function should , following a risk -based approach, have the capacity to \\nindependently review and provide objective assurance of the compliance of all ICT and security -\\nrelated activities and units of a financial institution  with the financial institution ’s policies and \\nprocedures and with external requirements, adhering to the requirements of Section  22 of the \\nEBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11) . \\n12. Financial institutions  should define and assign key roles and responsibilities, and relevant \\nreporting lines , for the ICT and security risk management framework to be effective. This \\nframework should be fully integrated into , and aligned with,  financial  institutions ’ overall risk \\nmanagement processes.  \\n13. The ICT and security risk  management framework should  include  processes in place to : \\na) determine the risk appetite for ICT and security risk s, in accordance with the risk appetite \\nof the financial  institution ; \\nb) identify and assess the ICT and security risk s to which a financial institution  is exposed ; \\nc) define mitigation  measures, including controls,  to mitigate  ICT and security risk s; \\nd) monitor the  effectiveness of these measures as well as  the number of reported  incidents, \\nincluding for PSPs the incidents reported in accordance with Article  96 of PSD2 affecting \\nthe ICT -related activities , and tak e action to correct the  measures  where necessary;  \\ne) report to the management body on the ICT and security risk s and controls ; \\nf) identify and assess whether there are any ICT and security risks resulting from any major \\nchange in ICT s ystem or ICT services, processes or procedure s, and/or after any significant \\noperational or security incident.  \\n \\n14. Financial institutions should ensure that the ICT and security risk  management framework is \\ndocumented, and continuously improved , based on ‘lessons learned ’ during its implementation \\nand monitoring. The ICT and security risk  management framework should be approved and \\nreviewed, at least once a year, by the management body . \\n3.3.2.  Identification  of functions, processes and assets  \\n15. Financial institutions  should identify, establish  and maintain up dated  mapping  of their business \\nfunctions, roles and supporting  processes to  identify  the importance of each  and their \\ninterdependencies related to ICT and security risk s. \\n16. In addition, financial institutions  shoul d identify, establish and maintain update d mapping of \\nthe information assets supporting their business  functions and supporting  processes, such as \\nICT systems, staff , contractors, third parties and dependencies on other internal and external \\nsystems and pr ocesses, to be able to , at least , manage the  information  assets that support their \\ncritical business functions and processes.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 17 \\n3.3.3.  Classification  and risk assessment  \\n17. Financial institutions  should classify the identified business functions , supporting processes and \\ninformation assets  referred to in paragraphs  15 and 16  in terms of  criticality.  \\n18. To define the criticality of these  identified  business functions, supporting processes and  \\ninformation assets, financial  institutions  should, at a minimum, consider the con fidentiality, \\nintegrity and availability requirements. There should be clear ly assigned  accountability and \\nresponsibility for the information assets.  \\n19. Financial institutions  should review the adequacy of the classification of the  information  assets \\nand rele vant documentation , when risk assess ment is performed . \\n20. Financial institutions  should identify the ICT and security risk s that impact the identified and \\nclassified business functions , supporting processes  and information assets , according to their \\ncriticality . This risk assessment should be carried out and documented annually or at shorter \\nintervals if required. Such risk assessments should also be performed on any major change s in \\ninfrastructure, process es or procedures affecting the business funct ions, supporting processes \\nor information assets , and consequently the current risk assessment of financial institutions \\nshould be updated . \\n21. Financial institutions  should ensure that they continuously monitor threats and vulnerabilities \\nrelevant to their bu siness  processes, supporting  functions and information assets and should \\nregularly review the risk scenarios impacting them.  \\n3.3.4.  Risk mitigation  \\n22. Based on the risk assessments, financial institutions  should determine wh ich measures are \\nrequired to mitigate identified  ICT and security risk s to acceptable levels and whether changes \\nare necessary to the existing business processes, control measures, ICT systems and ICT \\nservices . A financial institution  should consider the time  required to implement these changes \\nand the time to take appropriate interim mitigating measures to minimise ICT and security risks  \\nto stay within the financial institution ’s ICT and security risk  appetite . \\n23. Financial institutions  should define and impleme nt measures to mitigate identified ICT and \\nsecurity risk s and  to protect  information  assets in accordance with their classification.  \\n3.3.5.  Reporting  \\n24. Financial institutions should report r isk assessment  results  to the management body in a clear \\nand timely manner.  Such reporting is without prejudice to the obligation of PSPs to provide \\ncompetent authorities with an updated and comprehensive risk assessment , as laid down in \\nArticle  95(2) of Directive (EU)  2015/2366.  \\n3.3.6.  Audit  \\n25. A financial institution ’s governance, system s and processes for its ICT and security risk s should \\nbe audited on a periodic basis by auditors with sufficient  knowledge, skills and  expertise in ICT \\nand security risk s and in payments ( for PSPs ) to provide independent assurance of theirFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 18 \\neffectiveness to  the management body. The audit ors should be independent within or from the \\nfinancial institution. The frequency and focus of such audits should be commensurate with the \\nrelevant ICT and security risk s. \\n26. A financial institution ’s management body  should approve the audit plan, including any ICT \\naudits and any material modifications thereto. The audit plan and its execution, including the \\naudit frequency, should reflect and be proportionate to the inherent ICT and security risk s in \\nthe financial institution  and should be updated regularly.  \\n27. A formal follow -up process including provisions for the timely verification and remediation of \\ncritical ICT audit  findings  should be established.  \\n3.4. Information security  \\n3.4.1.  Information security policy  \\n28. Financial institutions should develop and document an information security policy that should \\ndefine the high -level principles and rules to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability \\nof financial institutions ’ and their customers ’ data and information. For PSPs this policy is \\nidentified in the security policy document to be adopted in accordance with Article  5(1)(j) of \\nDirective (EU)  2015/2366.  The information security policy should be in line with the financial \\ninstitution ’s information security objecti ves and based on the relevant results of the risk \\nassessment process.  The policy should be approved by the management body.  \\n29. The policy should include a description of the main roles and responsibilities of information \\nsecurity management , and it should set  out the requirements for staff  and contractors , \\nprocesses and technology in relation to information security, recognising that staff  and \\ncontractors  at all levels have responsibilities in ensuring financial institutions ’ information \\nsecurity. The policy should ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a financial \\ninstitution ’s critical logical and physical assets, resources and sensitive data whether at rest, in \\ntransit or in use. The information security policy should  be communicated to all staff  and \\ncontractors of the financial institution.  \\n30. Based on the information security policy, financial institutions should establish and implement \\nsecurity measures to mitigate the ICT and security risk s that they are exposed to. T hese \\nmeasures should include:  \\na) organisation and governance  in accordance with paragraphs  10 and 11 ; \\nb) logical security (Section  3.4.2); \\nc) physical security (Section  3.4.3); \\nd) ICT operations security (Section  3.4.4); \\ne) security monitoring (Section  3.4.5); \\nf) informatio n security reviews, assessment and testing  (Section  3.4.6); \\ng) information security training and awareness (Section  3.4.7). \\n3.4.2.  Logical securityFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 19 \\n31. Financial institutions should define, document and implement procedures for logical access \\ncontrol (identity and access management). These procedures should be implemented, \\nenforced, monitored and periodically reviewed. The procedures should also include controls \\nfor monitoring anomalies. These procedures should, at a minimum, implement the following \\nelements, where the term ‘user ’ also includes  technical users:  \\n \\n(a) Need  to know, least privilege and segregation of duties : financial institutions should \\nmanage access rights to information assets and their supporting systems on a ‘need -to-\\nknow ’ basis, including for remote access. Users should be granted minimum access \\nrights that are strictly required to execute their duties (principle of ‘least privilege ’), i.e. \\nto prevent unjustified access to a large set of data or to prevent  the allocation of \\ncombinations of access rights that may be used to circumvent controls (principle of \\n‘segregation of duties ’). \\n(b) User accountability:  financial institutions should limit, as much as possible, the use of \\ngeneric and shared user accounts and ensure that users can be identified for the actions \\nperformed in the ICT systems.  \\n(c) Privileged access rights: financial institutions should implement  strong contr ols over \\nprivileged system access by strictly limiting and closely supervising accounts  with \\nelevated system access entitlements (e.g. administrator accounts). In order to ensure \\nsecure communication and reduce risk, remote administrative access to critica l ICT \\nsystems should be granted only on a need -to-know basis and when strong \\nauthentication solutions are used.  \\n(d) Logging of user activities: at a minimum, all activities by privileged users should be \\nlogged and monitored.  Access logs should be secured to pr event unauthorised \\nmodification or deletion and retained for a period commensurate with the criticality of \\nthe identified business functions, supporting processes and information assets, in \\naccordance with Section 3.3.3, without prejudice to the retention requirements set out \\nin EU and national law. A financial institution should use this information to facilitate \\nthe identification and investigation of anomalous activities that have been detected in \\nthe provision of services.  \\n(e) Access management: access righ ts should be granted, withdrawn or modified in a timely \\nmanner, according to predefined approval workflows that involv e the business owner \\nof the information being accessed (information asset owner). In the case of termination \\nof employment , access rights should be promptly withdrawn . \\n(f) Access recertification: access rights should be periodically reviewed to ensure that users \\ndo not possess excessive privileges and that access rights are withdrawn when no longer \\nrequired.  \\n(g) Authentication methods : financial institutions should enforce authentication methods \\nthat are sufficiently robust to adequately and effectively ensure that access control \\npolicies and procedures are complied with. Authentication methods should be \\ncommensurate with the criticali ty of ICT systems, information or the process being \\naccessed. This should , at a minimum , include complex passwords or stronger  \\nauthentication methods (such as two -factor authentication) , based on relevant risk.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 20 \\n32. Electronic access by applications to data and  ICT systems should be limited to a minimum \\nrequired to provide the relevant service.  \\n3.4.3.  Physical  security  \\n33. Financial institutions ’ physical security measures should be defined, documented and \\nimplemented to protect their  premises, data centres and sensitive areas from unauthorised \\naccess and from environmental hazards.  \\n34. Physical access to ICT systems should be permitted to only authorised individuals. Authorisation \\nshould be assigned in accordance with the individual ’s tasks and responsibilities and limited to \\nindividuals who are appropriately trained and monitored. Physical access should be regularly \\nreviewed to ensure that unnecessary access rights are promptly revoked when not required.  \\n35. Adequate measures to protect from environmental hazards should be commensurate with the \\nimportance of the buildings and the criticality of the operations or ICT systems located in these \\nbuildings.  \\n3.4.4.  ICT operations security  \\n36. Financial institutions should implement procedures to prevent the occurrence of security issues \\nin ICT systems and ICT services  and should minimise their impact on ICT service delivery. These \\nprocedures should include the following measures:  \\na) identification of potential vulnerabilities , which should be evaluated and remediat ed \\nby ensuring that software and firmware are up to date , including the software provided \\nby financial institutions to their internal and external users , by deploying critical \\nsecurity patches or by implementing compensating controls;  \\nb) implementation of secure configuration baselines of all network components;  \\nc) implementation of network segmentation, data  loss prevention systems and the \\nencryption of network traffic (in accordance with the data classification) ; \\nd) implementation of protection of endpoints including servers, workstations and mobile \\ndevices ; financial institutions should evaluate whether endpoint s meet the security \\nstandards defined by them before they are  granted access to the corporate network;  \\ne) ensuring that mechanisms are in place to verif y the integrity of software, firmware and \\ndata ; \\nf) encryption of data at rest and in transit  (in accordance with the data classification) . \\n37. Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, financial institutions should determine whether changes in \\nthe existing operational en vironment influence the existing security measures or require \\nadoption of additional measures to mitigate related risks appropriately. These changes should \\nbe part of the financial institutions ’ formal change management process, which should ensure \\nthat ch anges are properly planned, tested, documented , authorised  and deployed . \\n3.4.5.  Security monitoring  \\n38. Financial institutions should establish and implement policies and procedures to detect \\nanomalous activities that may impact financial institutions ’ information se curity and to respond \\nto these events appropriately. As part of this continuous monitoring, financial institutionsFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 21 \\nshould implement appropriate and effective capabilities for detecting and reporting physical or \\nlogical intrusion as well as breaches of conf identiality, integrity and availability of the \\ninformation assets. The continuous monitoring and detection processes should cover:  \\na) relevant internal and external factors, including business and ICT administrative \\nfunctions;  \\nb) transactions to detect misuse of  access by third parties  or other entities and internal \\nmisuse of access;  \\nc) potential internal and external threats.  \\n39. Financial institutions should establish and implement processes and organisation structures to \\nidentify and constantly monitor security threa ts that could materially affect their abilit ies to \\nprovide services. Financial institutions should actively monitor technological developments to \\nensure that they are aware of security risks. Financial institutions should implement detective \\nmeasures , for instance to identify possible information leakages, malicious code and other \\nsecurity threats, and publicly known vulnerabilities in software and hardware and should check \\nfor corresponding new security updates.  \\n40. The security monitoring process should also help a financial institution to understand the \\nnature of operational or security incidents, to identify trends and to support the organisation ’s \\ninvestigations.  \\n3.4.6.  Information security reviews, assessment and testing  \\n41. Financial institution s should perform  a variety of information security reviews, assessments and \\ntesting to ensure the effective identification of vulnerabilities in their  ICT systems  and ICT \\nservices . For instance , financial institutions may perform gap analysis against information \\nsecurity standards, compliance reviews, internal and external audits of the information \\nsystems, or physical security reviews. Furthermore, the institution should consider good \\npractices such as source code reviews, vulnerability assessments, penetration tests and red \\nteam  exercises . \\n42. Financial institutions should establish and implement a n information security  testing \\nframework that validates the robustness and effectiveness of the ir information security \\nmeasures and ensure that this framework considers threats and vulnerabilities, identified \\nthrough threat monitoring and ICT and security risk  assessment process.  \\n43. The information  security testing framework should ensure that tests:  \\na) are carried out by independent testers with sufficient knowledge, skills and expertise \\nin testing information security measures and who  are not involved in the development \\nof the information security measures;  \\nb) include  vulnerability scans and penetration tests (including threat -led penetration \\ntesting where necessary and appropriate) commensurate  to the level of risk identified \\nwith the business processes and systems.  \\n \\n44. Financial institutions should perform ongoing and r epeated tests of the security measures. For \\nall critical ICT systems (paragraph  17), these tests should  be performed at least on an annual \\nbasis  and, for PSPs, they will be part of the comprehensive assessment of the security risksFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 22 \\nrelated to the payment s ervices they provide , in accordance with Article  95(2) of PSD2. Non -\\ncritical systems should be tested regularly using  a risk -based approach, but at least every \\n3 years.  \\n45. Financial institutions should ensure that tests of security measures are conducted in t he event \\nof changes to infrastructure, processes or procedures and if changes are made because of \\nmajor operational or security incidents or due to the release of new or significantly changed \\ninternet -facing critical applications.  \\n46. Financial institutions should monitor and evaluate the results of the security tests and update \\ntheir security measures accordingly without undue delays in the case of critical ICT systems.  \\n47. For PSPs, the testing framework should also encompass the security measures relevant to ( 1) \\npayment terminals and devices used for the provision of payment services, ( 2) payment \\nterminals and devices used for authenticating the payment service users (PSU), and ( 3) devices \\nand software provided by the PSP to the PSU to generate/rec eive an authentication code.  \\n48. Based on the security threats observed and the changes made, testing should be performed to \\nincorporate scenarios of relevant and known potential attacks.  \\n3.4.7.  Information security training and awareness  \\n49. Financial institutions shoul d establish a training programme , including periodic security \\nawareness programmes, for all staff  and contractors  to ensure that they are trained to perform \\ntheir duties and responsibilities consistent with the relevant security policies and procedures \\nto reduce human error, theft, fraud, misuse or loss  and how to address information security -\\nrelated risks . Financial institutions should ensure that the training programme provides training \\nfor all staff members and contractors at least annually.  \\n3.5. ICT operations management  \\n50. Financial institutions  should manage their ICT operations based on documented and \\nimplemented processes and procedures (which, for PSPs, include the security policy document \\nin accordance with Article  5(1)(j) of PSD2) that are approved  by the management body. Th is set \\nof documents should define how financial institutions  operate, monitor and control the ir ICT \\nsystems and services, including the documenting  of critical ICT operations and should enable \\nfinancial institutions  to maintain u p-to-date ICT asset inventory.  \\n51. Financial institutions should ensure that performance of their ICT operations is aligned to the ir \\nbusiness requirements. Financial institutions  should maintain and improve , when possible , \\nefficiency of their ICT operations , including but not limited to the need to consider how to \\nminimise potential errors arising from the execution of manual tasks . \\n52. Financial institutions  should implement logging and monitoring procedures for critical ICT \\noperations to allow the detect ion, analysis and correction of errors.  \\n53. Financial institutions  should maintain an up-to-date inventory of their ICT assets (including I CT \\nsystems, network devices, databases, etc .). The ICT asset inventory should store theFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 23 \\nconfiguration of the ICT assets a nd the links and interdependencies between the different ICT \\nassets , to enable a proper configuration and change management process.  \\n54. The ICT asset inventory should be sufficiently detailed to enable the prompt identification of an \\nICT asset, its location, security classification and ownership. Interdependencies between assets \\nshould be documented to help in the response to security and operational incidents, including \\ncyber -attacks.  \\n55. Financial institutions  should monitor and manage the life cycle s of ICT ass ets, to ensure that \\nthey continue to meet and support business and risk management requirements. Financial \\ninstitutions  should monitor whether  their ICT assets are supported by their external or internal \\nvendors and developers and whether all relevant patc hes and upgrades are applied based on \\ndocumented process es. The risks stemming from outdated or unsupported ICT assets should \\nbe assessed and mitigated.  \\n56. Financial institutions  should implement performance and capacity planning and monitoring \\nprocess es to prevent, detect and respond to important performance issues of ICT systems and \\nICT capacity shortages in a timely manner.  \\n57. Financial institutions  should define and implement  data and  ICT system s backup and \\nrestoration procedures to ensure that they can be recovered as required. The scope and \\nfrequency of backups should be set out in line with business recovery requirements and the \\ncriticality of the data and the ICT systems and evaluated according to the performed risk \\nassessment . Testing of the backup and restoration procedures  should be undertaken on a \\nperiodic basis.  \\n58. Financial institutions  should ensure that data and ICT system backups are stored securely and \\nare sufficiently remote from the primary site so they are n ot exposed to the same risks.  \\n3.5.1 ICT incident  and problem m anagement  \\n59. Financial institutions should establish and implement an incident and problem management \\nprocess to monitor and log operational and security ICT incidents  and to enable financial \\ninstitutions  to continue or resume , in a timely manner, critical business functions and processes \\nwhen disruptions occur . Financial institutions  should determine appropriate criteria and \\nthresholds for classifying event s as operational or security incident s, as set out in the \\n‘Definitions ’ section of these guidelines, as well as early warning indicators that should serve as \\nalert s to enable early detection of these incidents. Such criteria and threshold s, for PSPs, are \\nwithout prejudice to the classificatio n of major incidents in accordance with Article  96 of PSD2 \\nand the Guidelines on major incident reporting under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2017/10).  \\n60. To minimise the impact of adverse events  and enable timely recovery , financial institutions  \\nshould establish appropriate processes and organisational structures to ensure a consistent and \\nintegrated monitoring, handling and follow -up of operational and security incidents  and to \\nmake sure that the root causes are identified and eliminated to prevent the occurrence of \\nrepeated  incidents. The incident and problem management process should establish:  \\na) the procedures to identify, track, log, categorise and classify incidents according to a \\npriority , based on business criticality ;FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 24 \\nb) the roles and responsibilities for different inciden t scenarios (e.g. errors, \\nmalfunctioning, cyber -attacks);  \\nc) problem management procedure s to identify, analyse and solve the root cause behind \\none or more incidents — a financial institution should analyse operational or security \\nincidents likely to affect t he financial institution that have been identified or have \\noccurred within and/or outside the organisation  and should consider key lessons \\nlearned from these analyses and update the security measures accordingly;  \\nd) effective internal communication plans, including incident notification and escalation \\nprocedures  — also covering security -related customer complaints — to ensure that : \\ni) incidents with a potentially high  adverse impact on critical ICT systems and \\nICT services are reported to the relevant senior mana gement and ICT \\nsenior management ; \\nii) the management body is informed on an ad  hoc basis in the event  of \\nsignificant incidents  and, at least, informed of the impact, the response  and \\nthe additional controls to be defined as a result  of the incidents . \\ne) incident response procedure s to mitigate the impacts related to the incidents and to \\nensure that the service becomes operational and secure in a timely manner;  \\nf) specific external communication plans for critical business functions and processes  in \\norder to : \\ni) collabor ate with relevant stakeholders to effectively respond to and \\nrecover from the incident ; \\nii) provide timely information to external parties (e.g. customers, other \\nmarket participants, the supervisory authority ) as appropriate and in line \\nwith an applicable regu lation . \\n3.6. ICT project and change management  \\n3.6.1.  ICT project management  \\n61. A financial institution  should implement a program me and/or a project governance process  \\nthat defines roles, responsibilities and accountabilities to effectively support the \\nimplementation of  the ICT strategy.  \\n62. A financial institution  should appropriately monitor and mitigate risks deriving from the ir \\nportfolio of ICT projects  (program me management) , considering also risks that may result from \\ninterdependencies between different projects and fr om dependencies of multiple projects on \\nthe same resources and/or expertise.  \\n63. A financial institution  should establish and implement an ICT project management policy that \\nincludes as a minimum:  \\na) project objectives;  \\nb) roles and responsibilities;  \\nc) a project risk assessment;  \\nd) a project plan, timeframe and steps;FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 25 \\ne) key milestones;  \\nf) change management requirements.  \\n64. The ICT project management policy should ensure that information security requirements are \\nanalysed and approved by a function that is independent from the dev elopment function . \\n65. A financial institution  should ensure that all areas impacted by an ICT project are represented \\nin the project team and that the project team has the knowledge required to ensure secure and \\nsuccessful project implementation.  \\n66. The e stablis hment and progress of ICT projects and their associated risks should be reported to \\nthe management body, individually or in aggregat ion, depending on the importance and size of \\nthe ICT projects, regularly and on an ad hoc basis as appropriate. Financial institutions  should \\ninclude project risk in their risk management framework.  \\n3.6.2.  ICT systems acquisition  and development  \\n67. Financial institutions  should develop and implement a process governing the acquisition, \\ndevelopment and maintenance of ICT systems. This process should be designed using a risk -\\nbased approach . \\n68. A financial institution  should ensure that , before any acquisition or development of  ICT systems \\ntakes place, the functional and non -functional requirements (including information security \\nrequirements) are clearly defined  and approved by the relevant business management.  \\n69. A financial institution  should ensure that measures are in place to  mitigate the risk of \\nunintentional  alteration or intentional manipulation of the ICT systems during development  \\nand implementation  in the production environment . \\n70. Financial institutions  should have a methodology in place for testing and approval of ICT \\nsystems prior to their first use.  This methodology should consider the criticality of business \\nprocesses and assets. The testing should ensure that new ICT systems perform as intended . \\nThey should also use test environments that adequately reflect the product ion environment . \\n71. Financial institutions  should test ICT systems , ICT services and information security measures \\nto identify potential  security weaknesses, violations and incidents.  \\n72. A financial institution  should implement  separate I CT environments to ensure adequate \\nsegregation of duties and to mitigate the impact of unverified changes to production systems. \\nSpecifically, a financial institution  should ensure the segregation of production environments \\nfrom development, testing and oth er non -production environments. A financial institution \\nshould ensure the integrity and confidentiality of production data in non -production \\nenvironments . Access to production data is restricted to authorised users.  \\n73. Financial institutions  should implement measures to protect the integrity of the source code s \\nof ICT systems that are developed in -house.  They should  also document  the development, \\nimplementation, operation and/or configuration of the ICT systems comprehensive ly to reduce \\nany unnecessary dependency on subject matter experts. The documentation of the ICT system \\nshould contain, where applicable, at least user documentation, technical system \\ndocumentation and operating procedures.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 26 \\n74. A financial institution ’s processes for acquisitio n and development of ICT systems should also \\napply to ICT systems developed or managed by the business function ’s end users outside the \\nICT organisation (e.g. end user computing  applications ) using a risk -based approach . The \\nfinancial institution  should ma intain a register of these applications that support critical \\nbusiness functions or processes . \\n3.6.3.  ICT change management  \\n75. Financial institutions  should establish and implement an ICT change management process to \\nensure that all changes to ICT systems are record ed, tested, assessed, approved, implemented  \\nand verified  in a controlled manner.  Financial institutions should handle the changes during  \\nemergenc ies (i.e. changes that must be introduced as soon as possible) following procedures \\nthat provide adequate safeguards . \\n76. Financial institutions  should determine whether changes in the existing operational \\nenvironment influence the existing security measures or require the adoption of additional \\nmeasures to mitigate the risk s involved. These changes should be in accordance with the \\nfinancial insti tutions ’ formal change management process.  \\n3.7. Business continuity  management  \\n77. Financial institutions should establish a sound business continuity management (BCM) process \\nto maximise their abilities to provide services on an ongoing basis and to limit losses i n the \\nevent of severe business disruption  in line with Article  85(2) of Directive  2013/36/EU and \\nTitle  VI of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11) . \\n3.7.1.  Business impact analysis  \\n78. As part of sound business continuity management, financial institutions should conduct \\nbusiness  impact analysis ( BIA) by analysing their exposure to severe business disruptions and \\nassessing their potential impact s (including on confidentiality, integrity and availability) , \\nquantitatively and qualitatively , using internal and/or external data (e.g. third party provider \\ndata relevant to a business process or publicly available data that may  be relevant to the BIA ) \\nand scenario analysis. The BIA should also consider the criticality of the identified and classified \\nbusiness functions, supporting processes , third parties  and information assets, and their \\ninterdependencies , in accordance with Section  3.3.3. \\n79. Financial institutions  should ensure that their ICT systems and ICT services  are designed and \\naligned with their BIA, for example with redundancy of certain critical components to prevent \\ndisruptions caused by events impacting those components.  \\n3.7.2.  Business continuity planning  \\n80. Based on the ir BIAs, financial institutions  should establi sh plans to ensure business continuity \\n(business continuity plans , BCPs), which should be documented and approved by the ir \\nmanagement bod ies. The plans should specifically consider risks that could adversely impact \\nICT systems and ICT services. The plans s hould support objectives to protect and, if necessary,FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 27 \\nre-establish the  confidentiality,  integrity and availability of their business functions, supporting \\nprocesses and information assets. Financial institutions  should coordinate with relevant \\ninternal an d external stakeholders, as appropriate, during the establishment of the se plans . \\n81. Financial institutions  should put BCPs  in place to ensure that they can react appropriately to \\npotential failure scenarios and that they are able to recover  the operation s of their critical \\nbusiness activities after disruption s within a recovery time objective (RTO, the maximum time \\nwithin  which a system or process must be restored after an incident) and a recovery point \\nobjective (RPO, the maximum time period during which it is acceptable for data to be lost in \\nthe event  of an incident). In case s of severe business disruption that trigger specific business \\ncontinuity plan s, financial institutions  should prioritise business continuity actions using risk -\\nbased approach, which  can be based on the risk assessments carried out under Section  3.3.3. \\nFor PSPs this may include , for example, facilitating the further processing of critical transactions \\nwhile remediation efforts continue.  \\n82. A financial institution  should consider a range of different scenarios  in its BCP, including \\nextreme but plausible ones to which it might be exposed, including a cyber -attack scenario, and \\nit should assess the potential impact that such scenarios might have. Based on these scena rios, \\na financial institution  should describe how the continuity of ICT systems and services, as well as \\nthe financial institution ’s information security, are ensured.  \\n3.7.3.  Response and recovery plans  \\n83. Based on the BIA s (paragraph  78) and plausible scenarios (pa ragraph  82), financial institutions  \\nshould develop response and recovery plan s. The se plans  should specify what conditions may \\nprompt activation of the plan s and what actions should be taken to ensure the availability, \\ncontinuity and recovery of, at least,  financial institutions ’ critical ICT systems and ICT services. \\nThe response and recovery plans  should aim to meet the  recovery objectives of financial \\ninstitutions ’ operations.  \\n84. The response and recovery plans  should consider both short -term and long -term recovery \\noptions. The plans should:  \\na) focus on the recovery of the operations of critical business functions, supporting \\nprocesses, information assets and their interdependencies to avoid adverse effects on \\nthe functioning of financial institutions  and on  the financial system, including on \\npayment systems and on payment service users, and to ensure execution of pending \\npayment transactions;  \\nb) be documented and made available to the business and support units and re adily \\naccessible in the event  of an emergency;  \\nc) be updated in line with lessons learned from incidents, tests, new risks identified and \\nthreats, and changed recovery objectives and priorities.  \\n85. The plans should also consider alternative options where recover y may not be feasible in the \\nshort term because of cost s, risks, logistics or unforeseen circumstances.  \\n86. Furthermore, as part of the response and recovery plans , a financial institution  should consider \\nand implement continuity measures to mitigate failure s of third party providers, which are of \\nkey importance for a financial institution ’s ICT service continuity  (in line with the provisions ofFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 28 \\nthe EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements (EBA/GL/2019/ 02) regarding business \\ncontinuity plans ). \\n3.7.4.  Testing of plans  \\n87. Financial institutions  should test their BCPs  periodically. In particular, they should ensure that \\nthe BCPs of their critical business functions, supporting processes,  information assets and their \\ninterdependencies (including those provided by third parties , where applicable ) are tested at \\nleast annually , in accord ance with  paragraph  89. \\n88. BCPs should be updated at least annually, based on testing results, current threat intelligence \\nand lessons learned from previous events. Any changes in recovery obje ctives (including RTO s \\nand RPO s) and/or changes in business functions, supporting processes and information assets , \\nshould also be considered, where relevant, as a basis for updating the BCPs.  \\n89. Financial institutions ’ testing of their BCPs should demonstrate that they are able to sustain the \\nviability of the ir business es until critical operations are re -established. In particular they should:  \\na) include testing of an adequate set of severe but plausible scenarios including those \\nconsidered for the dev elopment of the BCPs ( as well as testing of services provided by \\nthird parties, where applicable) ; this should include the switch -over of critical business \\nfunctions, supporting processes and information assets to the disaster recovery \\nenvironment and demo nstrating that they can be run in this way  for a sufficient ly \\nrepresentative  period of time and that normal functioning can be restored afterwards;  \\nb) be designed to challenge the assumptions on which BCPs rest, including governance \\narrangements and crisis co mmunication plans; and  \\nc) include procedures to verify the ability of their staff  and contractors , ICT systems  and \\nICT services  to respond adequately to the scenarios defined in paragraph  89(a). \\n90. Test results should be documented and any identified deficiencie s resulting from the tests \\nshould be analysed, addressed and reported to the management body.  \\n3.7.5.  Crisis communications  \\n91. In the event of a disruption or emergency, and during the implementation of the BCPs, financial \\ninstitutions  should ensure that they have effective crisis communication measures in place so \\nthat all relevant internal and external stakeholders, including the competent authorit ies when \\nrequired by national regulation s, and also relevant providers  (outsourcing prov iders, group \\nentit ies, or third party provider s) are informed in a timely and appropriate manner . \\n3.8. Payment service user relationship management  \\n92. PSPs should establish and implement processes to enhance PSUs ’ awareness of the security \\nrisks linked to the paym ent services by providing PSUs with assistance and guidance.  \\n93. The assistance and guidance offered to PSUs should be updated in the light of new threats and \\nvulnerabilities, and changes should be communicated to the PSU.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 29 \\n94. Where product functionality permits, PSPs should allow PSUs to disable specific payment \\nfunctionalities related to the payment services offered by the PSP to the PSU.  \\n95. Where, in accordance with Article  68(1) of Directive (EU)  2015/2366, a PSP has agreed with the \\npayer spending limits for payme nt transactions executed through specific payment \\ninstruments, the PSP should provide the payer with the option to adjust these limits up to the \\nmaximum agreed limit.  \\n96. PSPs should provide PSUs with the option to receive alerts on initiated and/or failed att empts \\nto initiate payment transactions, enabling them to detect fraudulent or malicious use of their \\naccount s. \\n97. PSPs should keep PSUs informed about updates in security procedures that affect PSUs \\nregarding the provision of payment services.  \\n98. PSPs should pro vide PSUs with assistance on all questions, requests for support and \\nnotifications of anomalies or issues regarding security matters related to payment services. \\nPSUs should be appropriately informed about how such assistance can be obtained.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 30 \\n4. Accompanying documents  \\n4.1. Draft cost -benefit analysis /impact assessment  \\nAs per Article  16(2) of Regulation (EU)  No 1093/2010 (EBA Regulation), any guidelines and \\nrecommendations developed by the EBA are to  be accompanied by an impact assessment (IA), \\nwhich an alyses ‘the potential related costs and benefits ’. \\nThis section presents a cost -benefit analysis of adopting the guidelines described in this \\nConsultation Paper by financial institutions. Given the nature and the scope of the guidelines, the \\nIA is high  level and qualitative in nature.  \\nA. Problem identification  \\nThe c omplexity of ICT risks is increasing and the frequency of ICT -related incidents (including cyber \\nincidents) is rising , together with their potential significant adverse impact s on the operational  \\nfunctioning  of financial institutions. Moreover, due to the interconnectedness of financial \\ninstitutions, ICT -related incidents risk causing potential systemic impact s. \\nFor PSPs, ICT plays an important role in the efficient functioning of payment systems.  A recent risk \\nanalysis exercise conducted by the EBA and the European Central Bank ( ECB) identified various \\nthreats and vulnerabilities that PSPs are currently exposed to when providing their payment \\nservices. The most common risks are:  \\ni. inadequate protect ion of communication channels used for payments;  \\nii. inadequately secured I CT systems used for payments;  \\niii. unsafe behaviour of users and PSPs;  \\niv. technological advancements and tools that are available to potential fraudsters or \\nmalicious attackers.  \\nFor institution s, ICT is a key resource in developing and supporting banking services; ICT systems \\nare not only key enablers of institutions ’ strategies, forming the backbone of almost all banking \\nprocesses and distribution channels, but they also support the automated c ontrols environment on \\nwhich core banking data are  based. ICT systems and services also represent material proportions \\nof institutions ’ costs, investments and intangible assets. Furthermore, technological innovation \\nplays a crucial role in the banking sect or from a strategic standpoint, as a source of competitive \\nadvantage, as it is a fundamental tool for compet ing in the financial market through  new products \\nas well as through facilitating the restructuring and optimisation of the value chain. As a result of \\nthe increasing importance of ICT in the banking industry, some recent trends include:  \\ni. the emergence of cyber risks together with the increased potential for cybercrime;  \\nii. the increasing reliance on third parties for ICT services and products, often in th e form of \\ndiverse packaged solutions and resulting in manifold dependencies and potential \\nconstraints and concentration risks.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 31 \\nIn view of the growing importance and increasing complexity of ICT and security risk s for financial \\ninstitutions , and based on th e mandates set out for the EBA, the EBA has published:  \\na) Guidelines on ICT risk asses sment under the supervisory review and evaluation process  (SREP ), \\naddressed to competent authorities (EBA/GL/2017/05);  \\nb) Guidelines on security measures for operational  and security risks of payment services, \\naddressed to PSPs (EBA /GL/2017/17).  \\nThe guidelines above in point  (b) set out very important requirements for PSPs for the provision of \\ntheir payment services , but, for credit institutions that are PSPs the existing guidelines do not \\naddress ICT and security risk s from their other activities.  Furthermore , the guidelines in point  (b) \\ndo not apply to investment firms. The new Guidelines on ICT and security risk management  aim to \\naddress the European Commission request7 for guidelines for all institutions regarding their ICT \\nsecurity and governance. The aim is to ensure sound ICT and security management in the EU \\nfinancial sector and to ensure a level playing field for all institutions.  The new guidelines integrate \\nthe existing text of the ‘Guidelines on security measures ’ and broaden the scope of addressees, \\nnamely covering all activities for credit institutions and investment firms. Furthermore, the new \\nguidelines build on  the existing requirements in the ‘Guidelines on security measures ’ but are more \\nexplicit, clarifying in more detail how institutions can ensure adequate management of their ICT \\nand security.  \\nB. Policy objectives  \\nThe main objective of the guidelines is to establish harmonised requirements for ICT and security \\nacross PSPs (for payment services) and institutions (for credit institutions and investment firms , this \\nextends to all activities). In return, this is expected to contribute to better management of ris ks \\narising to market integrity, consumers and the viability of institutions and PSPs from ICT.  \\nOperationally, the guidelines aim to integrate all provisions on ICT and security management in a \\nsingle legal text for all financial institutions and for a wide r range of activities.  \\nC. Baseline scenario  \\nThe status quo should constitute the baseline scenario. It entails maintaining the current regulatory \\nframework, which includes two pieces of legislation related to ICT and security risk  management:  \\ni. Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the supervisory review and evaluation process \\n(SREP) (EBA/GL/2017/05): these guidelines are addressed to competent authorities and are \\nintended to promote common procedures and methodologies for the assessment of the  \\nICT risk under the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP). The guidelines set out \\nthe requirements that competent authorities should apply in their assessment of ICT on \\n                                                                                                          \\n7 European Commission ’s FinTech action plan: for a more competitive and innovative European financial sector, \\n8 March 20 18, COM(2018)  109 final.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 32 \\nthe general provisions and application of scoring as part of the SREP assess ment of risks to \\ncapital, assessment of institutions ’ governance and strateg ies on ICT, and the assessment \\nof institutions ’ ICT and security risk  exposures and controls.  \\nii. Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment serv ices \\nunder Directive (EU)  2015/2366 (PSD2) (EBA /GL/2017/17): these guidelines set out the \\nrequirements that PSPs should implement to mitigate operational and security risks \\nderived from the provision of payment services , which in practice relate to the imp act of \\nthe operational and security risks on their ICT systems.  \\nD. Options considered  \\nScope  \\nOption  1a: Develop a separate set of Guidelines on ICT and security risk  management  addressed \\nonly to credit institutions and investment firms, and maintain the Gui delines on the security \\nmeasures for operational and security risks of payment services under Directive (EU)  2015/2366 \\n(PSD2) for PSPs.  \\nOption  1b: Develop a single set of Guidelines on ICT and security management addressed to PSPs \\nfor their payment services and to credit institutions and investment firms for all activities,  \\nintegrating (and consequently repealing) the Guidelines on the security measures for operational \\nand security risks of payment services under Directive (EU)  2015/2366 (PSD2).  \\nLeve l of detail in prescribed requirements  \\nOption 2a: Set out detailed and prescriptive requirements on ICT and security management . \\nOption 2b: Set out high -level principle -based requirements on ICT and security management . \\nE. Cost -benefit analysis and preferr ed options  \\nScope  \\nOption  1a would mean a new set of Guidelines on ICT and security management  for credit \\ninstitutions and investments firms for all activities and services. However, given that most of the \\nrequirements that apply to the  security of payment s ervices (i.e. those already within the published \\nGuidelines  on security measures) are also applicable for security of other services and activities, the \\ntwo set s of guidelines would have significant overlap and would create confusion for credit \\ninstitution s wh ich already apply the Guidelines  on security measures for their payment services. \\nThis then means that the benefits of having two different guidelines are limited.  \\nOption  1b would ensure that the same requirements are set across PSPs for payment servic es (i.e. \\nnot extending beyond the PSD2 mandate), and for all institutions for all services, creating a level \\nplaying field.  The mandate for security measures for operational and security risks in payment \\nservices in practice refers to security measures for  operational and security risks on ICT systems. \\nTherefore,  it would also reduce the compliance burden for institutions, which will then need to \\nrefer to a single legal text for their requirements on ICT and security risk  management, irrespectiveFINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 33 \\nof the ser vice they provide. In addition, it can still take into account any specificities in the ICT and \\nsecurity risk  management for PSPs, by setting exclusive requirements for payment services.  \\nOption  1b is retained.  \\nLevel of detail in prescribed requirements  \\nOption 2a to include detailed and prescriptive requirements on ICT and security risk  management \\ncould increase comparability and create a level playing field across financial institutions. However, \\nthis option  risks requirements becom ing obsolete very quickly due to the ever -changing nature of \\nICT and security risk s. A financial  institution would be unable to ensure that its ICT and security risk  \\nmanagement properly mitigates ICT and security risk s in an ecosystem in which new threats are  \\nevolving continuously.  \\nOption  2b on the other hand would allow financial institutions to adapt their risk management \\nprocesses to new challenges and developments. Therefore , this option reflect s financial \\ninstitutions ’ need s to anticipate and mitigate unk nown types of ICT and security risk s. \\nOption  2b is retained.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 34 \\n4.2. Feedback on the public consultation  \\nSummary of responses to the consultation and the EBA ’s analysis  \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nGeneral \\ncomment — \\nimplementation  One respondent commented on the implementation of the guidelines, \\nsuggesting to add to Section  ‘background and rationale ’8, about how the \\nsupervision of the implementation of the guidelines is envisaged (e.g. \\npossible role for the competent authorities).  \\nOne respondent expressed concerns relating to the impact of these \\nguidelines on third party providers ( TPPs ), given the open banking \\nfacility in PSD2. Their concerns relate to how each competent authority \\nwill comply with these guidelines , as a possible re strictive interpretation \\ncould  introduce barrier s to entry, impact the number of TPPs and \\nnegatively affect the growth of open banking. Moreover, it was noted \\nthat the guidelines can be interpreted liberally or restrictively by \\ncompetent authorities. This could result in new entrants requesting \\nauthorisation and licence from jurisdictions with a less restrictive \\ninterpretation of the guidelines for the provision of their cross -border \\nservices. Consequently, consumers may be exposed to different ICT \\nsecurity  levels and risks. The need for a more legally binding text (i.e. a \\nlevel 1 text) was also proposed by the same respondent.  The \\nresponden t noted the possibility of the ‘deceptive ’ implementation of \\nthe guidelines by institutions and therefore called for sanctions to \\nenforce the implementation of the guidelines. This is to avoid a situation \\nwhere, in a potential fraud case caused by a TPP, consumers may blame \\nthe banks for exposing them to loss of reputati on and credibility, as the \\nbanks hold the client relationship. Sanctions could be a useful tool for \\nsupervisors to protect customers and financial services. They also \\nsuggested introducing and applying industry standards (such as an open In line with EBA standard practice, the guidelines do  not \\ncover implementation aspects in detail. Any practical \\nquestions can be addressed through the EBA Single \\nRulebook Q&A facility or through bilateral discussions \\nwith competent authorities.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe EBA guidelines are principle based. Any \\nspecification o f details would create a  situation in \\nwhich  one size does not fit all institutions. Furthermore, \\nthe EBA guidelines are technology and methodology \\nneutral , with an expectation for institutions to focus on \\ntheir security, based on a robust process ( Section  3.3), \\ninstead of on detailed compliance aspects.  \\n \\n \\n No change . \\n                                                                                                          \\n8 Section numbers and paragraph numbers in this column relate to the numbering in the draft guidelines.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 35 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\napplication progra mming interface ( API)) and industry solutions (such as \\nthe PSD2 hub), which can embrace technology and ensure adequate \\nsecurity, while maintaining minimum security standards acceptable to \\nthe industry.  \\nGeneral \\ncomment — \\nprinciples vs \\nrules in the \\nguidelines  A few comments were received on the guidelines being principle based \\nversu s being rules based. Some respondents supported and encouraged  \\nthe EBA ’s use of the principle -based approach , commenting that this is \\nessential and should be maintained as far as possible. Specifically the \\nfocus on outcomes that allow firms to demonstrate capabilities was \\ncited as increasing consistency. This approac h ensures that the \\nguidelines can be implemented with proportionality in mind.  \\nPrinciple -based guidance also provides the flexibility required for the \\ncontinuously evolving nature of technology risks and avoids prescriptive \\nand detailed requirements that m ay become obsolete over time. This \\nwould increase consistency and alignment with the Bank for \\nInternational Settlements ( BIS) Committee on Payments and Market \\nInfrastructures (CPMI ) International Organi sation of Securities \\nCommissions (IOSCO ) guidance ‘Cyber resilience for financial market \\ninfrastructures ’. Where more detailed guidance is provided , the EBA \\nshould consider separating these out as examples or use cases, such as \\nhow the three line s of defence could be implemented to provide \\nexamples of how the requirements could apply or be interpreted.  \\nOther respondents considered that some requirements in the \\nguidelines are too prescriptive and too detailed and are thereby limiting \\nthe risk management options available to financial institutions (such as \\ngovernance structures, internal controls and other security -related \\nmeasures). This was considered to put at risk the ability of the guidelines \\nto withstand the rapid nature of changes in the ICT and information \\nsecurity risk landscape in the years to come. It might also ultimately limit The EBA agrees with a principle - based approach, and \\nthe guidelines are drafted with this explicit intention. \\nThe EBA intends to ensure that the guidelines are \\nprinciple  based and flexible enough to facilitate the ir \\napplication to all the relevant institution s in the sector. \\nFurthermore, it is important to ensure that the \\nguidelines remain valid in the continuously evolving \\ntechnological environment. The EBA ’s aim is not to be \\noverly prescriptive but to cover the main important \\nareas o f ICT and security risk m anagement. In several \\nparts the detailed points are drafted as examples to be \\nconsidered.  That said, a number of specific points have \\nbeen amended based on the current supervisory \\ninsights for future developments in ICT and security risk \\nmanagement maturity.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 36 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nfinancial institutions ’ abilit ies to innovate with in the information and \\ncybersecurity domain.  \\nOne respondent noted that a departure from the existing recognised \\nstandards increases regulatory complexity and requires resources to be \\ndiverted from other activities , inhibiting firms from focusing their efforts \\non the identification of and protection against technological risks, thus \\nincreasing  the amount of  firms ’ resources that are focusing on \\ncompliance rather than on technological security. This respondent  \\nrecommended the international harmonisation of ICT rules  in the EU \\nand globally, as diverging regulatory requirements will significantly \\nincrease operating costs and will  introduce risks of regulatory arbitrage.  The guidelines do not aim to promote one set of \\nstandards over another. The EBA agrees with the need \\nto harmonis e regulatory requirements and finds that \\nthese guidelines are sufficiently principle based that \\nthey do not contradict existing  standards.  No change . \\nGeneral \\ncomment — \\nrisk-based \\napproach  One respondent suggested that a risk -based approach should be \\nadopted in these guideline s, especially whe re controls are mentioned.  This is taken on a case -by-case basis throughout the \\nguidelines ; however , in general the guidelines are to be \\napplied proportionately , taking into account the risks \\nthat the financial institutions are exposed to.  Changes made on \\na case -by-case \\nbasis . \\nStandardisat ion \\nof all ICT \\nguidelines  One respondent commented that the guidelines seem to separate the \\n‘business ’ and ‘IT’ functions within an organisation, thus not taking into \\naccount new configurations, represented particularly  by FinTech  start -\\nups. It was further commented that new  developments in I CT seem to \\nbe ignored, such as cloud computing and distributed ledger technology \\n(DLT), along with the issues of end -to-end data encryption in the course \\nof data processing ; access to data, whi ch conflicts with banking \\nconfidentiality ( General Data Protection Regulation , GDPR), \\nmanagement of ICT security in the form of internal outsourcing, etc.  \\nThe same respondent understood that the objective of these guidelines \\nwas to integrate and standardis e all ICT guidelines (in force and under \\nimplementation), taking into account relevant national guidelines . The guidelines cover ICT from a holistic business point \\nof view, using the overall business strategy and \\nbusiness processes as a starting point. If new entrants \\nare primarily tech nology  driven, business strategy and \\nICT strategy will coincide, but this does not change the \\nexpectations on formulating and approving such \\nstrategies.  \\nThe guidelines are technology agnostic. It is up to an \\ninstitution to en sure that appropriate security \\nmeasures are implemented, e.g. by using new \\ntechnologies or by leveraging more traditional \\ntechnologies. The EBA cannot specify all details or all \\ntechnologies.

Some issues are not \\naddressed in these guidelines because there already \\nexist  EU-level regulation s and guidelines on these \\ntopics (e.g. data -related questions are regulated in the \\nGDPR, and cloud security is also handled in the EBA \\nGuidelines on outsourcing ). \\nReference to \\ninternational  \\nstandards  Some respondents proposed that the guidelines are linked — where \\nrelevant — to European and international \\npractices/requirements/standards/regulation s relating to ICT risk \\nmanagement that are already in place. Examples include (1) the \\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB) Cyber Lexicon , (2) the Basel Committee ’s \\n‘Principles for the sound management of operational risk’, (3) the FSB ’s \\n‘Guidance on arrangements to support operational continuity in \\nresolution , (4) the EBA ’s ‘Guidelines on outsourcing ’, (5) the ECB’s \\n‘Cyber resilience oversight expectations for financial market \\ninfrastructures ’, and  (6) International Organization for Standardization \\n(ISO) 27001/2 for controls and ISO  27005 for risk management. Without \\nan explicit reference or a gap analysis, it is currently not clear how the \\nguidelines overlap or complement the existing standards in place. In \\naddition, overly general guidelines are open to interpretation both by \\norganisations and by supervisors in each Member State , and references \\nto existing standards will ease harmonisation across Member States and \\nprovide assis tance in the consistent interpretation of requirements.  \\nOne respondent commented that the guidelines do not  mention any \\ninternational standard  and appear to be a stand -alone best  practice for \\nthe whole sector. However, much of the guidelines work should be (or \\nshould already have been) taken from international standards (e.g. ISO) The aim of EBA was to ensure that these guidelines are \\ntechnology and methodology agnostic and do not \\nprescribe any particular international standards or \\nstand -alone good practices.  \\nIt would not be feasible for the EBA to mention all the \\nexisting standards and regulation s in the text of the \\nguidelines. However, in the executive summary, the \\nEBA high lights the two main regulations (PSD2 and \\nCRD IV) as these guidelines elaborate how to comply \\nwith their requirements. Furthermore, the executive \\nsummary has been amended with r eferences to the \\nexisting EBA guidelines.  \\nThe ECB cyber resilience oversight ex pectations for \\nfinancial market infrastructures are aligned with these \\nguidelines , but the main difference is in their scope, as \\nthe ECB cyber resilience oversight expectations specify \\ndetails for financial market infrastructures, while these \\nguidelines  apply to institutions.  \\nThe EBA considers that keeping these guidelines \\nprinciple  based allows them to be applied by all kind s The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 38 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nand tailored to the financial institution environment.

A request was made to reference the existing guidelines in \\nthese new guidelines.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The EBA has amended the executive summary with \\nreferences to existing EBA guidelines that are r elevant \\nto these guidelines.  \\nThe Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the \\nsupervisory review and evaluation process  \\n(EBA/GL/2017/05) are addressed to competent \\nauthorities , while these guidelines are addressed to \\nfinancial institutions. For these guidelines to add value \\nit was agreed not to do a direct map ping  of the \\nrequirements but to word them in a way that makes it \\neasier for the financial institutions to read over and \\napply  them . \\nThese guidelines are directed at financial institutions \\nand cover  ICT and security risk management from a \\nholistic perspective. In particular, the definition of ICT \\nand security risk details that this covers data \\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability. This is also \\nfound  in other definitions, such as of  incidents, and is \\nincluded in processes such as the classification and risk \\nassessment process. The aspect of data integrity , \\ntherefor e, is fully integrated into the entire guideline, \\ninstead of being dealt with as a specific risk type.  \\nIn contrast, the EBA/GL/2017/0 5 guideline s are \\ndirected at supervisors.

The final guidelines have been updated with the final \\naccurate references.  The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nSubject matter, \\nscope and \\ndefinitions — \\naddressees  A question was received on the addressees about why  these guidelines \\n(EBA/CP/2018/15) are addressed to institutions related to PSD2, while \\nthe Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the supervisory review and \\nevaluation process  (EBA/GL/2017/05) have a bro ader scope. If an entity \\nis not related to PSD2, will the EBA/GL/2017/05 guidelines continue to \\napply? If an entity is related to PSD2, are both guidelines going to apply, \\nor only this last one (EBA/CP/2018/15)?  The addressees of the EBA guideline — the subject of \\nthe consultation (EBA/CP/2018/15) — are not only the \\ninstitutions related to PSD2, but a broader range of \\ninstitutions under the EBA remit ( e.g. investment firms \\nand other activities of the credit institutions).  \\nThese guidelines do not repeal t he Guidelines on ICT \\nrisk assessment under the supervisory review and \\nevaluation process (EBA/GL/2017/05) , so they both \\nshould be applied according to their scope/addressees.  \\nNote that EBA/GL/2017/05 is intended for supervisors, \\nnot financial institutions.  The EBA expects that if \\nfinancial institutions implement the Guidelines on ICT \\nand security risk management, providing supervisors \\nwith the input required for EBA/GL/2017/05 should not \\nlead to undue burdens.  No change . \\n \\nDefinitions — \\ngeneral  A few comments were received recommending that the definitions are \\naligned as far as possible with the definitions with in international \\npublications on technology and cybersecurity risks such as the FSB Cyber \\nLexicon and the ECB cyber resilience oversight expectations (CROE) or \\nto use standard definitions ( e.g. from control objectives for information \\nand related technology (COBIT ), ISO , etc.) where possible.

In particular, when ICT \\nrisk is meant to includ e security/ cyber risk.  the existing definition from the EBA Guidelines on \\ncommon procedures and methodologies for SREP and \\nstress testing (EBA/GL/2014/13 consolidated version) \\nand the definition of security risk from the EBA \\nGuidelines on the sec urity measures for operational \\nand security risks of payment services under Directive \\n(EU)  2015/2366 (PSD2) (EBA /GL/2017/17) ; therefore , \\nno change is required.  \\nAs specified in the scope of these guidelines \\n(paragraph  7), for the purposes of these guideline s, the \\nterm ICT and security risk addresses the operational \\nand security risks of Article  95 of PSD2 (including cyber \\nrisk) .  \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\nDefinitions  Management body — one respondent commented that the definition \\ncould be supplemented with a  reference to paragraph  8 of the \\nGuidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11). Other \\nrespondents commented that t here are different management body \\nstructures and responsibilities in the EU jurisdictions and that the \\ndefinition  should be clarif ied if this refers to the Board of Directors or \\nthe executive management of the bank.  The definition of ‘management body ’ references level  1 \\nlegislation and the EBA does not consider that there is \\na need to specify this further.  No change . \\nDefinitions  Operational or security incident — a few respondents suggested using \\njust the word ‘incident ’, which would allow it to be aligned with the FSB \\nCyber Lexicon definition of ‘incident ’. A further comment was received \\nthat the current wording describes a risk and not an operational or \\nsecurity incident.  \\nAnother comment suggested revising the wording , as ‘continuity ’ is \\nalready included in  the definition of  ‘availability ’ and is therefore \\nconsidered redundant.  \\nAnother respondent suggested deleting the text ‘…systems and… ’ from \\nthe definition, as ‘ICT system continuity ’ has been covered by The wording  ‘operational or security incident ’ is \\npurposefully used to address the requirements of \\nArticle  95 of PSD2 , and also ‘incident ’ has a wider \\nmeaning in the financial sector.

The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nDefinitions  Risk tolerance — some respondents suggested using ‘risk appetite ’, \\nwhich is more common. The use of ‘risk appetite ’ would also be \\nconsistent with other EBA guidelines (e.g. SREP, internal g overnance). \\nFurthermore, one respondent explained that risk tolerance is \\nunderstood as the variability regarding the established risk appetite that \\nthe organisation  can accept under some circumstances. They \\ncommented that risk appetite can consider  the aggregate level of risk as \\na medium value of the addition of risks in the organisation , and not only \\ntheir addition. One suggestion to overcome this was to add this term \\ninto the text (hence, risk tolerance or risk appetite). Another respondent \\ncommen ted that, in relation to paragraph  13a) , ‘risk tolerance ’ is a term \\nused in connection with the investments , whereas the whole document \\nis about ICT -related risks , so they suggested provid ing more details \\nrelating to ICT in the definition.   The EBA agrees to change the definition to ‘risk \\nappetite ’, to coincide with the use of this in the EBA \\nGuidelines on internal governance (EBA /GL/2017 /11), \\nthe Guidelines on the revised common procedures and \\nmethodologies for the supervisory review and \\nevaluation process (SREP) and supervisory stress \\ntesting (EBA /GL/2014 /13) and the Guidelines on \\nsecurity measures for operational and security risks \\n(EBA /GL/2017 /17). The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nDefinitions  ICT projects  — comments suggested that the de finition should refer to  \\nICT projects ’ ‘end of life ’ or ‘removal ’ as part of wider ICT and business \\ntransformation programmes , while a suggestion was received to add \\nthe word ‘dismissed ’ to refer to this same notion , as the removal of ICT \\nsystems should be treated with  the same caution as that given  to their \\nchange, replacement or implementation. Another respondent \\ncommented that the definition is too wide and suggested shortening it \\nto ‘Any project where ICT systems and services are changed, replaced \\nor implemented. ICT projects can be part of wider ICT or business \\ntransformation programmes. ’ The EBA considers that shortening the definition would \\nadversely impact the intention of the definition ; \\nhowever , it is reasona ble to add the phrase ‘dismissed ’ \\nto the definition. Adding this completes the definition.

Another respondent suggested harmonising this  \\ndefinition with the wording in paragraph  17.   \\n \\n \\nThe definition of ‘information asset ’ derives from the \\ndefinition of ‘asset ’ in the FSB Cyber Lexicon , but is \\nclarified to refer specifically to ‘information assets ’, as \\nboth ‘information ’ and ‘ICT assets ’ are defined in these \\nguidelines , whereas the FSB Cyber Lexicon was not \\nspecific.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDefinitions  ICT asset — a proposal was received to consider the use of the similar \\ndefinition of ‘asset ’ from the FSB Cyber Lexicon reference.  \\nAnother suggestion was received to clarify the wording to ‘an asset \\neither of software and or hardware, that is found in the business \\nenvironment ’.

Furthermore, the \\nguidelines deal with structured and unstructured data ; \\ntherefore , the EBA considers it inappropriate to single \\nout structured data.  \\n2) ‘Project implementation leadership ’ is used in the \\ntext in its general meaning . There is no need to specify \\nits meaning.  \\n3) ‘Adequate knowledge ’ has no special meaning in this \\ntext. The knowledge should be proportionate to what it \\nrelates to.  \\n4) ‘Information security function ’ has already b een \\nmade clear in the text from the context and the  \\nresponsibility associated with it . The intention is not to \\nbe too prescriptive about the roles and responsibilities \\nfor this function ; therefore , the EBA does not want to \\nexplicitly link it to the CISO.

In \\nparagraph  18 the text has been amended and updated \\nto ‘There sho uld be clearly assigned accountability and \\nresponsibility for the information assets .’   \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\n \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nProportionality  One respondent asked that additional wording be added in order to be \\nclear on the obligation of all addressees to comply with the new \\nguidelines. This new wording should set out that proportionality cannot \\nbe understood as grounds for exemption and that all addressees should \\naddress and manage their ICT and security risks. One respondent asked \\nthat p roportionate application or implementation according to the \\nindividual risk situation should be made possible.  \\nOne respondent commented that , although appropriate, the principle \\nof proportionality may lead to financial institutions excluding the \\nimplementation of security controls, based solely on cost factors. The \\nprinciple of proportionality must be closely monitor ed by the \\nmanagement bodies (or even the regulator) that will issue the relevant \\nguidelines. Hence, the respondent suggested considering the \\namendment of Section  4.1 and its association with Section  4.2.1.  \\nAnother respondent suggested including a more comp rehensive set of \\nprinciples governing the proportionate application , or a differentiation \\nbetween minimum requirements and those that could be applied \\nproportionately , in order for institutions to achieve compliance with \\ncompetent authorities ’ needs.  All EBA guidelines must be applied proportionately by \\nall those to whom these guidelines are addressed (see \\n‘Addressees ’). Proportional application is specified in \\nparagraph  1 of the guidelines  (see Section  3.1). \\nCompliance with the provisions will be monitored by \\ncompetent authorities. The basis of proportionality is \\nspecified in this paragraph.  \\n \\nCompetent authorities have the responsibility of \\nmonitoring proportionate  application. In line with \\nparagraph  1 the EBA expects that competent \\nauthorities take into account the institution ’s risk \\nprofile.  \\n \\n \\n \\n No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 46 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nAnother suggested that ‘proportionality ’ is better expressed as ‘a \\ngraded approach ’ according to the specific context, objectives, \\nconditions and needs of financial institutions. The respondent \\nsuggested that it is appropriate to set minimum criteria (fact ors) to be \\ntaken into account and proposed the following for paragraph  4.1: ‘The \\nmanagement body should apply the graded approach to comply with \\nthe provisions set out in these guidelines in such a way that is \\nproportionate to, and takes account of, at lea st the following factors: \\na) security significance of the financial institution and its parts, b) the \\nfinancial institution ’s size and complexity, c) internal organisation, d) \\nthe nature, scope, complexity and riskiness of the services and \\nproducts that th e financial institutions provide or intend to provide, e) \\nthe strategy and the goals. The factors used to grade the development \\nand application of the guidelines shall be documented. ’ \\nAnother respondent commented that adapting to the requirements in \\nthe guidelines could be a significant problem for organisations operating \\non a small scale, such as cooperative banks, payment services \\ninstitutions and FinTech start -ups. The application of the principle of \\nproportionality should be clarified to specify which aspects are \\nimportant for these organisations and which are not. This applies \\nparticularly to countries where ‘gold -plating ’ occurs. This can lead to \\nother negati ve outcomes, such as the migration of payment institutions \\nto more ‘liberal ’ countries.   \\nThese are principle -based guidelines that, as explained \\nin paragraph  1 of the guidelines ( see Section  3.1), \\nshould be applied by all institutions in a proportionate \\nmanner. The application of these guidelines is not for \\ncompetent authorities ’ needs but for institutions to \\nensure that they manage their ICT and security risks \\nproportionately. Furthermore using a graded approach \\nwould limit the implementation of principle -based \\nguidelines and it is the right of the management body \\nto establish proportionate application.  \\n \\n \\nThese guidelines will be applied for more services and \\nby more addressees than the Guidelines on security \\nmeasures for operational and security risk under PSD2 \\n(EBA/GL/2017/17). It is important that the guidelines \\nare ‘size neutral ’ and are  applicable to all addressees.  \\n \\nAll institutions must apply all the guidelines in a \\nproportionate manner based  on paragraph  1 (see \\nSection  3.1).  \\n4.2. ICT \\ngovernance and   \\nstrategy  Some respondents commented on the management body ’s roles, \\nspecifically requesting that it is specified that the executive function of \\nthe management body deal s with the ICT function and strategy but that \\nthe accountability of the executive function ( the Executive Board) \\nshould focus on risk strategy and risk appetite and should  challenge \\ndecisions of the ICT function. Therefore , the Executive Board ’s The guidelines intend to place the responsibility and \\naccountab ility with  the management body , in particular \\nregarding strategy and governance due , which is in line \\nwith paragraphs  23(a) and 23(b) of the EBA Guidelines \\non internal governance (EBA /GL/2017/11).  No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 47 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nresponsibil ities should be amended in the guidelines (in paragraph  4) to \\npermit delegation where appropriate, e.g. in implementing processes. \\nThe need for the management body to approve specific risk -type \\npolicies should also be reconsidered.  One respondent elaborate d \\nconcerns that the drafting would significantly expand the management \\nbody ’s obligations to include the day -to-day activities regarding the \\ndesign and implementation of ICT governance and strategy. This level of \\ngranularity is not considered necessary , given that the management \\nbody discharges its obligation to ensure that an adequate control \\nframework is in place , as detailed in paragraph  2. \\nAnother respondent proposed replacing ‘management  body ’ with \\n‘senior  management body ’, making reference to governan ce and  \\nmentioning the activity  of ‘ensuring ’. The respondent suggested \\npromoting a view of  ICT corporate governance and, by definition,  that \\nthe responsibility of governance belongs to the Executive Board while \\nthe responsibility of management belongs to  the management body.  \\nAnother respondent suggested that the management body should have \\nat least one expert in the  information security/ICT risks field in order to \\nproperly execute governance.  Paragraph  4 states that the oversight of \\nimplementation is for the management body , which is \\nin line with paragraph  23 of the EBA Guidelines on \\ninternal governance (EBA /GL/2017/11).  \\n \\nIn addition, the EBA does not state that the \\nmanagement body should formulate and draft the \\npolicies but considers that the general ICT and security \\nrisk management framework and information security \\nframework is of such particular importance that it \\nshould be approved periodically at the highest level.  \\n \\nThe term management body is used in line with the EBA \\nGuidelines on internal governance (EBA /GL/2017/11). \\nThe guidelines do not prescribe the composition (or \\npart of it) of the management body.  \\nThe EBA does not see a need to promote and define the \\nICT corporate governance in to the management body. \\nThe guidelines allow for implementa tion by all \\ninstitutions (according to their size or mandate).  \\n4.2.1 . ICT \\ngovernance  Paragraph  2 specifies that the management body is required to set roles \\nand responsibilities for information security risk and business \\ncontinuity, not only for ICT risks. The question is rather what \\nchapter  4.2.1 covers and should the chapter title reflect this , i.e. is it \\nonly ICT risk or also information security risk and business continuity?  Business continuity and information security are \\naddressed in th e guidelines in the context of ICT. This is \\nspecified in the wording in Section  3.2.

The respondent fully supported supervisors ’ \\nexpectations to ensure an appropriate budget for an institution to meet \\nits requirements on ICT governance and also agreed  on having an overall \\nsustainable budget, which is, in their understanding, to maintain the \\nability for an institution to (1) meet its current as well as expected future \\nfinancial obligations and (2) sustain growth, both primarily through \\ncurrent or past i ncome. Nevertheless, the respondent questioned the \\nrequirement for having a sustainable budget for such a limited scope as \\nICT governance, particularly as the support of operational needs and the \\nimplementation of risk management processes is associated wi th costs \\nand not directly related to income.  \\nThe concept of ‘key roles ’ in paragraph  3 is considered vague by some \\nrespondents , as it relates to training , and all staff should receive \\ninformation security training.  \\nOne respondent commented that the wording  contradicts the principle \\nin paragraph  30 of chapter  4.4.1, where it states that the information \\nsecurity policy should apply to all employees, and in paragraph  52 of \\nchapter  4.4.8, where training applies to all employees. Others wanted \\nto receive more de tail about what are considered ‘staff members \\noccupying key roles ’. \\nOne respondent suggested clarifying that the requirement for quantity \\nand skills of staff specifie s that it is for relevant  staff , as, in banks, only \\npart of the staff is responsible for performing the tasks listed. \\nHeightening the awareness of all staff is already addressed in, for \\nexample, paragraph  54. The n ew wording suggested  is ‘ …the quantity \\nand skills of financial institutions ’ relevant  staff is adequate … ’  The c omment has been accepted.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe EBA agrees with the need for information security \\ntraining for all staff members and in particular for key \\nfunction holders in the institution.  \\nThe guidelines have been updated  to state that training \\nis necessary for all staff including key function holders . \\nKey function holder has a meaning as set out in the EBA \\nGuidelines  on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11).  \\nFurthermore, financial institutions should ensure that \\non an annual basis, or more frequently if required,  all \\nstaff members including key function holders receive \\nappropriate training on ICT and security risks, including \\non information security.  \\n The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 49 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\n \\n \\n4.2.1 .  \\nParagraph  4 One respondent suggested drafting changes to paragraph  4, as the \\nobligations set out cover a level of activity that would in their view \\nreasonably be approved and overseen at a level below the management \\nbody: ‘The management body has overall accountability  responsibility  \\nfor ensuring an effective risk management framework for ICT risks is \\nin place, including ensuring there is an identified individual or forum \\nwithin the organisation  is responsible  for setting, approving and \\noverseeing the implementation of th at framework. of financial \\ninstitutions ’ ICT strategy as part of their overall business strategy as well \\nas for the establishment of an effective risk management framework for \\nICT risks.  \\nAnother respondent suggested after  ’management of ICT  risks ’ adding \\nthe following new text : ‘as the integral part of  overall business risk  \\nmanagement process .’ The EBA agrees with the suggestion that the \\nmanagement body is accountable  for and  not \\nresponsible for ensuring the effective risk management \\nframework. The text ha s been amended. Other wording \\nin this paragraph remains the same in order to remain \\nin line with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance \\n(EBA GL/2017/11).  The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended.  \\n \\n4.2.1 . \\nGovernance  One respondent commented that some requirements related to ICT \\nsecurity operating models (roles, responsibilities, reporting lines and \\nmechanisms) could be included.  The intention is to stay ‘size neutral ’ and allow \\nproportional application ; therefore , such a level of \\ndetail is not necessar y. No change . \\n4.2.2 . Strategy  \\nParagraph  5(a) One respondent suggested adding ‘compliance with applicable laws and \\nregulations ’ as a further component of the ICT strategy, as non -\\ncompliance signifies a business risk (and associated provisions in the \\nbusiness strategy).  \\nAnother respondent suggested adding in the first line ‘to effectively \\nsupport  and participate in their business strategy ’. This reflects the role \\nof ICT as  an integral part of processes, not only as a support function The EBA does not see a need to  prescribe the need for \\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations in \\nthese guidelines, as it is already prescribed in all of the \\nlaws and regulations.  \\n \\nThe EBA agrees that it is important to highlight the \\nimportance and functions of ICT on creating a nd \\nimplementing a company ’s business strategy.

Strategy  \\nParagraph  5(c) \\n— components \\nof ICT strategy  One respondent commented that there should be room for a separate \\ninformation security strategy as long as there is a clear connection to \\nthe ICT strategy — this relates to paragraph  5(c) where it is specified \\nthat the ICT strategy should contain information security objectives.  \\n \\nAnother respondent asked if ICT assets should be added here (i.e. \\nsoftware and hardware — for example licen ces, redundant hardware, \\nup-to-date software and hardwa re, etc.)  \\nAnother respondent suggested adding at the end of the sentence ‘in \\nline with general security and governance policies established in \\norganisation ’. The text should also include the alignment of the ICT \\nstrategy with innovation , to avoid disruption and to support lean  digital \\ntransformation that is based on ICT architecture. It should also include \\nthe proper portfolio of changes to align ICT transformation in \\naccord ance with  business transformation.  The guidelines do not prohibi t the establishment of a \\nseparate information security strategy ; they  state only \\nthat there must be information security objectives in \\nthe company ’s ICT strategy. According to this, the \\nguidelines  do not mention the issue of the separate \\ninformation securi ty strategy, so there is a possibility \\nfor any institution to have a separate information \\nsecurity strategy , as long as it is in line with the \\ninformation security objectives of the ICT strategy.  \\nAll ICT assets are covered by the current wording ; \\ntherefore , there is no need to specifically mention them \\nat this point.  \\nAccording to the EBA, it is important that the security \\npolicies and ICT strategy must be aligned with each \\nother and with any innovation. This suggestion is \\ncovered in paragraph  4, which menti ons ‘ICT strategy \\nas part of their overall business strategy ’. Therefore, \\nthere is no need to introduce the suggested text in the \\nguidelines again.   \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n4.2.2 . Strategy  \\nParagraph  6 — \\naction plans to \\nsupport the ICT \\nstrategy  Two comments were received on the concept of ‘action plans ’ in \\nparagraph  6, which are said to support the ICT strategy. One respondent \\nsaid that the term ‘action plans ’ seems vague , and there is a request to \\nclarify what is meant by ‘action plans ’ and the associated expectations. \\nCould they be articulated as either initiatives , projects , programmes  or \\nan implementation program me supported by an action plan (priorities, \\ndeadlines, resources, etc.)? Another respondent suggested the The EBA agrees that the previous wording was a little \\ninaccurate and that a detailed, clarified text could help \\ninstitutions to implement the guidelines . Therefore the \\ncomments regarding action plans have been \\naccommodated , to clarify the i ntention.  \\n  \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 51 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nfollowing wording : ‘Financial institutions should establish a set of \\nmeasures to be taken to achieve the objectives of  action plans to \\nsupport  the ICT strategy, ... The action plans  These measures  should be \\nperiodically reviewed to ensure their relevance…. ’. \\nOne respondent commented that instead of ‘should be periodically \\nreviewed ’, the review should be performed and validated on a \\nmanagement committee level to ensure alignment with the overall \\nbusiness strategy.   \\n \\n \\nThe EBA does not consider this proposal too detailed or \\nunnecessary.   \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n4.2.3 . Use of \\nthird party \\nproviders \\n(reference to \\nthe EBA \\nGuidelines on \\noutsourcing  \\narrangements ) One respondent commented that addressing requirements across two \\ndifferent sets of guidelines (these and the EBA Guidelines on \\noutsourcing arrangements (EBA /GL/2019 /02)) could create uncertainty \\nabout the  applicable requirements or lead to differences in the \\ninterpretation by different  competent authorities about how  each \\ndocument is translated and implemented. Other  respondents suggested \\nleaving this section out , partially or completely , to avoid any confusion \\nwith the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrang ements \\n(EBA/GL/2019/02) and to avoid fragmentation of requirements and \\ninconsistencies across the services, activities and functions being \\noutsourced. Another respondent requested a clear alignment with the \\nrequirements set out in the EBA Guidelines  on out sourcing \\narrangements, as it remains unclear if it is necessary to differentiate \\nbetween parent entities based in another Member State and parent \\nentities based in a third country. Another respondent requested \\nclarification on the relation (if any) between  the concept of ‘appropriate \\nand proportionate security objectives and measures ’ in these guidelines \\nand the classification of outsourcing ( as critical  or not critical) proposed \\nby the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing.  The guidelines specify some requirements that address \\nthe specificities of ICT and security risk when \\noutsourcing and using third parties and complement \\nthe EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements \\n(EBA /GL/2019/02) ; therefore , this section is deemed to \\nadd va lue by giving  information about security \\nrequirements.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe requirements apply to the addressees of the EBA \\nGuidelines for any outsourcing or use of third parties , \\nregardless of where the parent entity is.  \\nThere is no contradiction or particular relati on between \\nthese guidelines and the distinction of critical or No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 52 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nimportant functions in the EBA Guidelines on \\noutsourcing arrangements.  \\n4.2.3 . Use of \\nthird party \\nproviders  One respondent asked for consistency in requirements across the \\nsectors because ‘intragroup ’ would include insurance companies , and in  \\nthe event that  a financial institution ’s ICT serves multiple subsidiaries , it \\nwould be complex to have different security  controls on different \\nsubsidiaries.  To create the necessary requirements for other sectors, \\nis the responsibility of the other European Supervisory \\nAuthorities (ESAs ). Therefore, it is not possible for the \\nEBA to define cross -sectoral requirements that m ust be \\napplied in all of the sectors. However the ESAs liaise \\nclosely on this topic in order to be aligned in their \\napproaches.  No change . \\nParagraph  7 A question was received asking if the measures set out in these \\nguidelines should be included in the outsourcing risk assessments \\nwhenever the outsourced service is related to payment services.  \\nOne respondent proposed the following changes  to clarify that the \\nprovision of services by third parties should not trigger the EBA \\nGuidelines on outsourcing arran gements:  ‘[…] including the measures \\nset out in these guidelines, when important  operational functions of \\npayment services and/or ICT services and ICT systems are outsourced, \\nincluding to group entities , or when using third parties .’. \\nWith regard to the wording ‘financial institutions should ensure the \\neffectiveness of the risk -mitigating measures as defined by their risk \\nmanagement framework ’, one respondent suggested that t he risk \\nmanagement framework of each institution could be enha nced through  \\na common risk management framework, such as the one already \\nestablished by the ECB — i.e. risk assessment questions of the ECB for \\noutsourcing providers. This common framework will help to ensure \\nconsistency among all institutions.  \\nThere was a  request to clarify that group entities  are covered only to the \\nextent applicable in line with current vendor risk obligations and The EBA considers that the measures in these \\nguidelines should be included in the outsourcing risk \\nassessments , as these general principles need to be \\napplied when outsourcing.  \\nThe scope of the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing \\narrangements is clearly specified in those guidelines. \\nThe intention of this section is to ensure that ICT and \\nsecurity risks are covered not only when outsourcing \\nbut also when using third parties. The EBA do es not \\nsupport the suggested modification in the wording. The \\noption of using third parties is an important issue, and \\nit is important to keep it in this point.  \\n \\nThe intention is not to specify one risk management \\nframework over another. The  guidelines are  principle  \\nbased.  \\n \\n No change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo chang e.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 53 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nintragroup service controls , i.e.: ‘ICT systems, are outsourced, including, \\nto the extent applicable,  to group entities… ’) The requirements of the guidelines must be applied to \\nany intragroup outsourcing, without any limitation or \\nlightening ; therefore , the EBA considers there is no \\nneed to specify or clarify the text.   \\nNo change . \\nParagraph s 7 \\nand 8  Requests for clarification were received for the specific use  of the \\nwording ‘critical or important ’ in both paragraphs  7 and 8 , to align with \\nthe EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements (EBA/GL/2019/02) , \\ni.e. ‘when critical or important operational functions… ’. \\nIn particular , one respondent suggested limiting paragraph 8 to (critical \\nor important) outsourcing of ICT services and ICT systems , as otherwise \\nthe principle of proportionality and the draft guidelines ’ objective to \\nfocus on risk might be contradicted. This is because they consider that \\nthe minimum contractual content outlined in paragraph  8 is too \\nextensive for the entirety of the potential ICT -related services or \\nsystems procured from third parties. Ra ther, the assessment of the \\nnecessity for specific contractual requirements should be within the \\nresponsibility of the institution, whereas, in line with the principle of \\nproportionality, necessity should be risk based.  The suggested wording (to add ‘critical or important ’ \\noperational functions) is not necessary, as the \\nguidelines apply for any outsourced service or system , \\nand it is the compan y’s right to determine whether it is \\ncritical or important , based on its proportionality.  \\n \\nThe guidelines are risk based and proportionality is \\nalready specified in the guidelines. Furthermore the \\nGuidelines on outsourcing arrangements set out the \\nguidance for critical and important outsourcing.   \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\nParagraph  8 The following r equests for cla rification on paragraph  8 were received : \\n(i) Paragraph  8: suggested rewording to clarify the sentence ‘…ensure \\nthat contracts and service level agreements with the provider ( third \\nparty  outsourcing provider or group entity , or third party provider) …’ \\n(ii) Paragraph  8(a): ‘appropriate and proportionate information \\nsecurity -related  objectives and  measures , including requirements such \\nas minimum cybersecurity requirements ’. The wording ‘information \\nsecurity -related  objectives ’ is not clear , so the respondent suggests \\nusing ‘measures ’ alone. Also ‘appropriate and proportionate \\ninformation security objectives, ICT risks  and measures […] ’  \\n \\n(i) The EBA considers that it is important to keep service \\nlevel agreement (SLA) in the text ; however , the wording \\nhas been clarified.  \\n \\n(ii) The EBA agrees with the suggestion.  \\n  \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 54 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\n(iii) Paragraph  8(a): the terms ‘minimum cybersecurity requirements ’ \\nand ‘data life cycle ’ are considered t o be vague , and there was also a  \\nsuggestion that these terms should be  removed and that the first part \\nof this section is enough: ‘appropriate and proportionate information \\nsecurity objectives and measures... ’. \\n(iv) Paragraph 8(b): one respondent commented that service level \\nagreements are currently only available on continuity , but there  should \\nalso be agreements on  vulnerability management /patching, as well as \\non release management o f system security items such as  antivirus  \\npatterns /engines. Another proposed redrafting was ‘Service -level \\nagreements, key performance indicators, reporting or other adequate \\nmeasures to ensure continuity of business -critical ICT services and ICT \\nsystems and performance targets under normal circumstances as well \\nas those provided by business continuity or contingency plans… ’. \\n(v) One respondent suggested including a new paragraph  8(d): ‘The \\nright to audit the provider to valida te compliance of the requirements \\nestablished in the contract. ’  (iii) ‘Minimum cybersecurity requirements ’ and ‘data \\nlife cycle ’ already exist in other ICT standards , so no \\nchange is needed.  \\n \\n \\n(iv) The suggested supplement is not necessary, as the \\ncurrent text covers all of the suggestions on other \\npoints: patching and vulner ability management  in \\nparagraph  8(a), key performance indicator ( KPI) in \\nparagraph  8(a), and reporting in paragraph  8(c) and \\nparagraph  9.

Generic KPIs and KRIs could be provided to \\nensure consis tency among financial institutions, at least to a certain \\ndegree, since other laws and regulations may impose diverse \\nrequirements. Such generic KRIs could include certifications of the \\noutsourcing provider against ISO  27001:2013, the Cloud Security \\nAllian ce (CSA) Cloud Control Matrix ( CCM ) and/or STAR certification (for \\ncloud providers). This will also assist the implementation of paragraph  9 \\nbelow (‘Financial institutions should monitor and seek assurance on the There is no intention to prescribe the use of KPIs an d \\nKRIs to monitor compliance, as this would be too \\ndetailed.

For the security measu res, a system and organisation \\ncontrols ( SOC)2 type  II security attestation by an independent assessor \\ncould be provided. Without explicitly stating compliance assurance, \\nservice providers can never move in the right direction. Similarly, \\nanother responden t suggested mentioning some examples of \\ninternationally accepted standards and certifications (e.g. certifications \\nto standards in the ISO/ International Electrotechnical Commission  \\n(IEC) 27000 family  and the International  Standard  on Assurance \\nEngagements (ISAE ) 3402 type II certification).   The suggestion is considered too prescriptive. The \\naddition of the suggested new sentence would limit the \\nregulation, and it would be  necessary to apply this \\nprovision also to intragroup service relationships.  \\n \\n \\nThe EBA does not consider that there is a need to \\nspecify such standards (e.g. SOC2) , as the guidelines are \\nprinciple based . \\n \\n No change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\nParagraph  9 One respondent  suggested limiting the applicability of paragraph  9 to \\n‘where considered appropriate in terms of related risks ’, i.e. in the case \\nof (material) outsourcings, as it considered the requirement to ‘seek \\nassurance on the level of compliance of ICT service or system providers \\nwith their security objectives, measures and performance targets ’ too \\nprescriptive and inexpedient. Monitoring and potential assurance of \\ncompliance should be appropriate to the service or system ’s relevance \\nand the  risk it poses, whereas the assessment of associated risks is \\nconducted by means of various mandat ory risk assessments , e.g. \\noutsourcing risk assessment s, vendor risk assessment s and information \\nsecurity risk assessments.

Use of \\nthird party \\nproviders  The use cloud services and related specific governance (CSA , etc.) , \\ntaking into account the different implementation models (SaaS, Paa S, \\npublic cloud, hybrid , etc.) and assurance mechanisms , should be \\nhighlighted in this chapter as being  increasingly important third party \\nservice provider s.  This is already included and r egulated in the EBA \\nGuidelines on outsourcing, so there is no need to have \\nthis specification here also.  No change . \\n4.2.3. Third \\nparty providers \\n— data centres  \\n One respondent suggested that data centres supporting financial \\ninstitution operations should  possess or adhere to internationally \\nrecognised certifications, controlled by independent auditors. There are \\na number of standards that greatly contribute to data centre security  \\nand that  could be included in the text: a m inimum tier 3 level of \\nredundanc y of the data centre infrastructure ensure s the  continuity of \\noperations; the ISO 27001 standard certifies the quality of an \\ninformation security management system, guaranteeing the \\nconfidentiality and availability of data; the ISO 14001 standard specifies \\nrequirements for an effective environmental management system; the \\nISO 9001 standard ensures effective quality management, providing a \\nsystematic approach to maintaining and improving customer \\nexperience; ISAE  3000 type 2 and ISAE  3402 type 2 reports ensure \\nadequate risk management, quality and reliability of internal processes; \\nISAE  3000 focuses on operational management ; and  ISAE  3402 focuses \\non financial reporting.  The EBA agrees with the concept and points that were \\nsuggested, but these would be too detailed  for the \\ngeneral  purpose of these guidelines.

The adoption of a well -recognised  security \\nmanagement framework is too limiting with regard to \\nthe ICT and security risk management of fi nancial \\ninstitutions.  No change . \\n \\n4.3.1 . \\nOrganisation \\nand objectives \\nrelating to ICT \\nrisk \\nmanagement \\nframework  Comments were received on the specification in the text of the three  \\nlines of defence (3LoD) model, with a request that the model for \\nimplementation should  not be specified, particularly as this is \\nconsidered to move away from the guidelines being ‘principle  based ’. \\nThe focus should be on ensuring an effective internal ris k management \\nand control model. This would be , for example , just a clear description \\nof what duties and responsibilities reside with the respective lines of \\ndefence , on an overall level. This description should be in line with \\nEBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance under \\nDirective  2013/36/EU. One respondent also highlighted that there is no \\nconsistent industry standard for the 3LoD model , whereby the model is \\nimplemented by institutions in accordance with their size, structure and \\ncomplexity. This has resulted in the allocation of information security \\nroles to the first or second line of defence  not being consistent in \\nindustry. The view w as also that the objectives of the guidelines are met \\nwithout the need to disrupt the existing enterprise risk management \\npractices. One respondent said that b anks should not be forced to \\nmanage ICT risks differently from the rest of their risks. Others sa id that \\nthis guidance may be deemed useful for smaller , less mature institutions \\nbut not for well -established institutions that already meet existing Financial institutions have to manage their ICT and \\nsecurity risks according to their general obligati ons on \\nrisk management set forth in EBA/GL/2017/11 \\nGuidelines on internal governance under \\nDirective  2013/36/EU.  \\nBased on the feedback received , the guidelines have \\nbeen amended to follow the ‘principle -based ’ \\napproach. Paragraphs  10 and 11 have been revised to \\nensure appropriate segregation of ICT operations, \\ncontrol, and internal audit functions, while \\nparagraphs  32 and 33 have been removed.

Meanwhile another respondent commented that the 3LoD \\nrequirement can be difficult for smaller  companies to me et, as they may \\nnot have enough people with adequate technical skills or the \\ninformation security background outside ICT support teams (second \\nline).  \\nOne of these respondents suggested the following wording  in \\nparagraph  10: ‘Financial institutions should identify and manage their \\nICT risks according to the three lines of defence model  an effective \\ninternal risk management and control model, including an \\nindependent risk control function, to identify and manage  these risks .’ \\nOne respondent proposed changes in paragraph  11: ‘… in charge of ICT \\nsystems, processes and security operations, which could be  acting as \\nthe first line of defence, should operate under the supervision of an \\ninternal control function, which could be acting as a second line of \\ndefence. This internal control function should take responsibility for the \\nmanagement of ICT risks.  The in ternal audit function, which could be  \\nacting as the third line of defence should have the capacity to \\nindependently review and provide assurance of the respective roles the  \\nabove -mentioned functions (see Section  4.3.6)  \\nOne respondent suggested consistently  using the term ‘financial \\ninstitutions ’ throughout these guidelines, instead of mentioning the \\nappropriate department or level (including the 3LoD) where the \\nresponsibility for a specific requirement lies. In addition, the respondent  \\nsuggested adjusting t he wording for the three lines of defence in \\nparagraphs  11, 13, 27, 32 and 33, as the three lines of defence are not \\ndescribed clearly and consistently.  operational units being the first line of defence. The \\nguidelines now focus in particular on the \\nresponsibilities of the management body and the \\nsecond line of defence control function (which usually \\nincludes t he information security function). Cross -\\nreferences to the EBA Guidelines on internal \\ngovernance (EBA/GL/2017/11) added to paragraphs  10 \\nand 11 are intended to incorporate in these guidelines \\ngovernance requirements that are (objectively) valid \\nfor the pur poses of these guidelines. For the avoidance \\nof doubt, references do not change or expand the \\nscope of the application of the EBA Guidelines on \\ninternal governance.  \\nBased on the feedback received, reference to the 3LoD  \\nmodel has been  removed. Instead parag raphs  10 and \\n11 have been revised to ensure the appropriate \\nsegregation of ICT operations, control , and internal \\naudit functions.  \\n \\nBased on the feedback received , the guidelines have \\nbeen amended to follow the ‘principle -based ’ \\napproach.

PSPs \\nshould also follow the 3LoD  model and an appropriate internal control \\nfunction.  Another respondent requested clarification of paragraph  11, \\nas in paragraph  10 the use of the 3LoD model  is a mandatory \\nrequirement, while paragraph  11 seems to leave it optional  to manage \\nthe ICT risks under this model , using the term ‘where the three lines of \\ndefence is applied ’. However, the respondent requested wording that \\nsuggests that the 3LoD  model is used but, for reason s of proportionality \\nin small financial institutions , risk management can be done as \\neffectively as necessary under a different approach. It should be more \\nimportant to create a robust ICT risk management with an independent \\ninternal control function than to formally stick to a model. This approach \\nwould be  especially valuable in situations where , due to head count , the \\nimplementation of all three lines of defence  would prove to be difficult.  The EBA considers that financial institutions have to \\nmanage their ICT and security risks according to their \\ngeneral obligations on risk management set forth in \\nEBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance \\nunder Directive  2013/36/EU.  \\nBased on the feedback received , the guidelines have \\nbeen amended to follow the ‘principle -based ’ \\napproach, and paragraphs  10 and 11 have been revised \\nto ensure appropriate segregation of ICT operations, \\ncontrol and internal audit functions. The revised \\nguidelines do not explicitly refer to the 3LoD model and \\ndo not prescribe to financial institutions how to \\nimplement the 3L oD model for ICT and security risk \\nmanagement purposes.  The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nParagraph  11 One respondent suggested changing the wording in paragraph  11 to \\n‘internal control function should take responsibility of the control of ICT \\nrisks ’. Currently, according to paragraph  11, an internal control function \\nin the seco nd line of defence should ‘take responsibility for the \\nmanagement of ICT risks ’, but this was considered unclear. The \\nsuggestion is to ensure that it is the same as the requireme nts defined \\nin EBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance under \\nDirective  2013/36/EU, paragraphs  174 to 180 on the risk management \\nfunction ’s role in identifying, measuring, assessing, managing, \\nmitigating, monitoring and reporting on risks.  \\nAnother respondent suggested that where it is mentioned that the \\nsecond line of defence should take ‘responsibility ’ for the management \\nof ICT risks, this should be  replace d with  ‘accountability ’, since the \\nresponsibility of manag ing ICT risks during the d aily tasks is the first line  Based on the feedback received, t he text has been \\nrevised and aligned with the wor ding of the \\nEBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance \\nunder Directive  2013/36/EU.

The second line would have an internal control function, but \\nnot the responsibility for the daily risk management.  \\nAnother respondent commented that the internal control function \\nshould be in the information securit y and operational risk management \\ndepartments , as it is not clear how one single department can manage \\nICT risks alone.  \\nAnother respondent commented that  the internal control function \\nshould be allowed to be organisationally situated outside the I CT \\ndepart ment in order to ensure independenc e and to avoid conflicts of \\ninterests.  \\nAnother respondent suggested moving this paragraph to an annex as \\nan example of a potential model framework for certain institutions with \\nless mature risk management functions. Some rewording was \\nsuggested here for this purpose: ‘…acting as the first line of defence, \\nshould operate under the supervision  oversight  of an internal control \\nfunction acting as a second line of defence. This internal control \\nfunction should take  responsibility for the  independently challenge \\nthe first line of defence ’s management of ICT risks ’. \\nOne respondent commented that there may be room to add a fourth \\nlevel that is provided by a regular external audit — both passive (e.g. \\nSOC2) and active (e.g. red teaming).  The EBA considers that one single department does not \\nhave to manage ICT and security risks alone. Following \\nthe feedback received , the wording of these guidelines \\nhas been revised to clarify that the assignment of the \\nresponsibilities for managing and overseeing ICT and \\nsecurity risks should adhere to the requirements of \\nSection  19 of  the EBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on \\ninternal governance under Direct ive 2013/36/EU.  \\nThe EBA considers that the independenc e of the control \\nfunction as the second line of defence is ensured.  \\n \\nFollowing the feedback received , these guidelines have \\nbeen revised and the wording of paragraph s 10 and 11 \\naligned with the wording of the EBA/GL/2017/11 \\nGuidelines on internal governance under \\nDirective  2013/36/EU.  \\n \\n \\n \\nThe EBA does not recognise a fourth level of defence .

The following \\nwording was suggested: ‘this framework should be fully integrated into, \\nand aligned with, financial institutions ’ overall risk management \\nprocesse s, including any interdependencies related to the ICT risk ’.

One respondent also suggested \\nproviding a list of common risks that should be considered in risk \\nassessment/ risk mitigation process es, for instance  the unavailability of \\nkey sta ff of financial institution s; the unavailability of data centre \\nfacilit ies (fire, power outage, power from city grid unavailable for 4,  8 or \\n24 hours ); cyber -attack ( distributed denial -of-service  (DdoS), \\nransomware); and data leakage (inside job, external attack).  (Some of \\nthe risks are listed in paragraph  39 in Section  3.2.1 , review of the \\ninstitutions ’ ICT risk profile in EBA/GL/2017/05).  \\nAnother respondent suggested switch ing paragraphs  13(a) and 13 (b) to \\nfirst identify and assess, and then determine , risk tolerance. Another \\nrespondent suggested considering rephrasing paragraph  13(a) as \\nfollows: ‘a) enable the management to determine an appropriate risk \\ntolerance for ICT risks,  […]’. The respondent stated  that paragraph  13 \\nprovided a non -exhaustive list of processes to be implemented as part \\nof the ICT risk management framework, including processes for \\ndetermining the risk tolerance for ICT risk. The respondent  noted that \\nthe in stitution ’s risk management framework contains processes to \\ndetermine the institution ’s risk -bearing capacity, based on which the \\ninstitution ’s management has to decide on its risk tolerance. The Risk appetite  is already further defined (see section  on \\ndefinitions, page  13). \\n \\nICT and security risk is defined in the section on \\ndefinitions.

It is advisable to define it at the risk mitigation \\nphase (Section  4.3.4) with the pertaining risk acceptance \\nannouncement , signed by senior management , on tolerating the \\nresidual risk items below the risk tolerance threshold.    \\n \\n \\n \\nSee comment above.  \\n \\nParagraph  13(c)  One respondent requested the definition of controls compar ed with \\nmitigation measures , i.e. of the mitigation measures, which ones are \\nconsidered controls.

No change . \\n \\nParagraph  13(f)  One respondent suggested that in order t o account for a timely \\nmitigation of the risks identified, as well as to track the implementation \\nof mitigating measures, the guidelines should  include an additional item \\n(i.e. paragraph  13(f)) to address the aforementioned aspects.

The respondent considered that this is subject to \\ndifferent interpretations , as ‘lesson s learned ’ documentation could be \\ninferred as being part of the project closure documentation or being the \\nlessons learned from ICT incidents and outages. In a ddition, they \\nrequest clarification on the level of documentation and the level of \\ncriticality of  the incidents that should be captured in the ‘lessons The EBA sees no need for further clarification on \\n‘lesson s learned ’ and its documentation , due to the \\noverall proportionality principle.

The respondent suggested the revised wording: ‘The ICT risk \\nmanagement framework should be approved and  reviewed, at least \\nonce a year , by the management body. ’ This would be in line with EBA \\nGuidelines  on internal governance  (see Section  17). Another suggested \\n‘The management body should ensure that the  ICT risk management \\nframework should be is approved and reviewed, at least once a year, by \\nthe individual or forum with delegated responsibility for ICT risks.  \\nappropriate management body .’ Another respondent stated that an \\napproval is  only necessary if there are  changes to the ICT risk \\nmanagement framework, as an approval of an  unchanged ICT risk \\nmanagement framework is inexpedient.  \\nSome respondents commented on the wording ‘major change ’, with \\none asking for clarification and another asking whether the intention  is \\nthat the risk  evaluation of major changes /information security  incidents \\nhas to be done formally in the general risk management process and \\nreported to those owners , or whether risk evaluation in the change or \\ninformation security  incident management p rocess is sufficient?

However , regarding such thresholds, they \\nrecommend that in paragraph  17 only information assets  that, when \\nnot available , would cause a signific ant client or sector impact should be \\nrequired to be mapped. The principle of proportionality and guidance \\nfor risk tolerance should be followed.  \\nAnother respondent suggested mentioning the holistic view of an \\norganisation  detailed on an appropriate enterprise architecture to \\ncontrol changes and impacts.

In addition, it requested a more detail ed \\nexplanation of  the mapping referred to.  ‘Information assets ’ was not meant to be used. See also \\ncomment below.

The requirement as it stands would be a \\nchallenge and probably  not sustainable.  \\nOne respondent suggested that financial institutions should also make \\nstatement s concerning th e importance of the identification of ICT risks \\nin their organisation s. The institutions should then do the mapping of \\nbusiness functions, roles and supporting processes and ICT \\ninfrastructures and link these to the ICT risks.  The mapping should include al l of a financial  \\ninstitution ’s business functions, roles , etc. and not us e \\na risk -based approach.  \\n \\n \\nThe mapping of the ICT infrastructures is a part of the \\nnext step (as in information asset), see paragraph  18.

The  respondent \\ntherefore also recommends that the EBA clarif ies the scope and \\nexpectation of firms , to ensure that this is realistically completed, in line \\nwith business criticality and firms ’ risk appetite s. \\nWith regard to third parties, it is not clear to the respondent if the \\nrequirements are in addition to the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing \\narrangements, in particular relating to inter -group arrangements or \\nfourth parties.

Clarification on this point is also relevant for further \\nparagraphs where criticality is m entioned, such as paragraph  49. \\nFurther more , the respondent was of the opinion that the costs \\nassociated with the classification of supporting processes and \\ninformation assets in addition to the business functions clearly exceed \\nthe potential benefits. It therefore suggested limiting the classification \\nin term s of criticality to business functions only and, if considered \\nnecessary, to major supporting processes related to critical business \\nfunctions.  \\nAnother respondent requested clarification on the classif ication of \\ncriticality of business functions with reference to areas such as  their key \\nroles in the financial statement, the decision -making process, 24/7 \\ncustomer service (e.g. e -channels), cash withdrawal, money transfer \\nand payment services, risk or compliance -related areas and strategic \\nplanning.  Each financial institution needs to define their own \\nlevel of criticality; therefore, the definition depends on \\nthe financial institution.  \\n \\nThe EBA considers that the result of the classification is \\nto know  different levels of criticality ; therefore , the \\nlower levels should not be excluded upfront.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n4.3.3 . \\nClassification \\nand risk \\nassessment   Some respondents suggested that criticality is defined by \\nregulations/standards , e.g. the payment card industry , the Society for \\nWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication  (SWIFT ) system  and Adding that the regulation requirements is to be \\nconsidered is too generic.

In their view , when a risk assessment takes \\nplace, the classification already assigned by the owner of the asset or \\ndocumentation should be considered to directly determine the possible \\nimpact that a risk event could produce.  Such a review needs to be done while the risk \\nassessment is performed.  No change . \\nParagraph  21 One respondent was of the opinion that carrying out risk assessments, \\ni.e. classification in terms of criticality, on supporting processes and \\ninformation assets is generally inappropriate and in particular is too \\nprescriptive. Consequently, the respondent  asked that the guidelines \\nlimit the applicability of paragraph  21, in particular in the case of the \\nclassification of supporting processes and information assets and also \\nfor business functions where risk assessments of the aforementioned \\nsubjects should be reviewed using  a risk -based approach. In line with \\nthis, major changes as listed in the second sentence in paragraph  21 or \\nchanges in the underlying ICT risks and related I CT systems should \\ntrigger a reassessment of risks.  \\nOne respondent requested that ‘business function ’ is defined. It also \\nsuggested that this point should be less restrictive so that different risk \\nmanagement methodologies can be implemented depending on th e See also the comment on paragraph  18. The criticality \\nassessment is done by the financial institution and \\nneeds to include the supporting processes and \\ninformation assets. The work needs to be done \\nextensively for each process. However, if the risk \\nassessment of a particular process shows that the \\nprocess is not vital/critical, then the supporting \\ninformation assets can be evaluated in a risk -based \\nprocess as well.

The view was that assessments of ICT risks once a year are \\nsufficient, since a new assessment takes place anyway during the course \\nof the year if the re are  major changes. Further assessments during the \\nyear are not appropriate.  \\nAnother respondent asked for clarification of or confirmation that this \\nparagraph  covers a risk -based approach , referring to ‘annually or at \\nshorter intervals, if required ’.

The view was that requiring individual risk \\nassessments to be reported to the management body is in many cases \\nirrelevant ( the information  is too detailed) and would demand \\ndisproportionate resources , compared with  the outcome.  \\nAnother respondent said that the management body should have the \\nability to delegate to an individual or forum , to ensure that its time is \\nnot dedicated to reading individual risk reports: ‘Risk assessm ent \\nresults should be reported to the management body  individual or \\nforum with the delegated responsibility for ICT risks in a timely \\nmanner. ’ \\nOne respondent said that ICT risk reporting should take place as part of \\na broader risk report to the management body and should not be \\nseparated out , as, if it is a top risk, it will be identified.  \\nThe timely reporting was commented on and it was suggeste d that it \\nshould be set to a specific threshold , as otherwise it leads to subjective \\nimplementation (e.g. quarterly or semi -annually) , and the reporting to \\ncompetent authorities should be set to annually. One respondent \\nsuggested add ing the word ‘documente d’ before ‘reported ’. \\nFurthermore , two comments were received about  delet ing the second \\nsentence , as the requirement is already dealt with comprehensively by \\nArticle  95(2) of Directive (EU)  2015/2366.

The respondent com mented that \\ninternal audit  is considered as being independent in financial \\ninstitutions ( by any applicable corporate governance model) and \\nshould be part of the audit. An external auditor will provide an \\nunbiased opinion ; nevertheless, this must also be part of the internal \\naudit  responsibilities.  \\nOne respondent considered that the methodology should be \\nperiodically updated, to guarantee that it covers requirements related \\nto new trends and changes in the payment ecosystem  (cloud \\nplatforms, big data, new technologies, new actors in the payment \\necosystem,  etc.). Therefore, the respondent proposed add ing the \\nfollowing sentence: ‘The methodology should be periodically \\nupdated, to guarantee it considers requirements related to new \\ntrends and changes in the payment ecosystem ’. \\nOne respondent asked for the final sentence ( ‘The frequency and focus \\nof such audits should be commensurate with the relevant ICT risks.)  to \\nbe replaced by: ‘The scope and frequency of the audits should be \\nbased on a risk assessment that takes into account the ICT assets \\nsupporting the critical business processes, the identified ICT risks, \\nand the prior outcome of ICT and security audits or management \\nreviews .’ The frequency of such audits is not specified a nd \\ndepends on the financial institution (see paragraph  26). \\n \\n \\nThe requirement is based upon the internal audit \\nrequirements of the relevant regulations and is \\ndeemed sufficient.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe requirement is based upon the internal audit \\nrequirements of the rele vant regulations.

This \\nshould be clarified in the requirement.  \\nSome respondents said that the wording  ‘and based on the relevant \\nresults of the risk assessment process ’ should be deleted, since the \\ninformation security policy establishes the information security \\nobjectives and the security framework of the financial institution. These \\nobjectives will deter mine the risk tolerance and how to manage the \\nresults of the risk assessment. However, the information security policy \\nis not based on the relevant results of the risk assessment process, as \\nstated in these guidelines. One respondent considered that the wo rding \\nin paragraph  29 should be changed by adding at the end:  ‘It shall take \\ninto account regulatory and legal requirements for financial \\ninstitutions and other legal provisions that affect ICT in general .’ \\nAnother respond ent suggested remov ing this paragraph, as this is \\nalready covered by Article  5 of Directive  2015/2366 (PSD2) , which \\nprescribes the conditions to obtain a licen ce.

Respondents suggested that \\nthe idea of clearly segregated lines  of defence should remain but \\nwithout assigning specific roles to each one of them . Specifically the \\nguidelines could include a clear description (in line with \\nEBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance) of what duties and \\nresponsibilities reside wit h the respective lines of defence, on an overall \\nlevel. Some examples were given by respondents to illustrate their \\nconcerns: there are cases where an information security function/ unit \\nalso includes security operations that are independent from the rest of \\nICT operations (e.g. firewall administration vs network administration ). \\nThis segregation ensures that information security is fully independent \\n(in terms of governance, organisation and technology) and cooperates \\nvery clo sely with I CT, but , as an operating model, it effectively creates \\nan overlap between the first and second lines as regards the information \\nsecurity role in this context.  In addition, it would be more efficient to \\nonly list the requirements regarding the se curity and risk management \\ncontrol objectives.  Paragraph  32 refers to the information security \\nfunction also as a function of the second line of defence and also \\nmentions that this function is responsible for the security policy and for  \\nmonitor ing its impl ementation and report ing to the management \\nindependently. This would imply that the CISO function would be part \\nof the second line of defence. It is not clear how this is related to the \\ninternal control function described in paragraphs  10 and 11. A revised  \\nwording for paragraph  32 was put forward: ‘Financial institutions should \\nestablish an information security function, with the responsibilit iesy for \\nit assigned to a designated person. Financial institutions should ensure \\nthe independence and objectivity of the information security function \\nby appropriately segregating it from ICT operations processes ( where Based on the feedback  received , the guidelines have \\nbeen amended to follow  a ‘principle -based ’ approach \\nby removing paragraphs  32 and 33, and revising \\nparagraphs  10 and 11.  The revised guidelines do not \\nprescribe to financial institutions how to implement the \\n3LoD model for ICT and security risk management \\npurposes. The EBA considers that these guidelines are \\nnow compatible with the 3LoD  model, with the ICT \\noperational units being the first line of defence. The \\nguidelines now focus in particula r on the \\nresponsibilities of the management body and the \\nsecond line of defence (which usually includes the \\ninformation security function) and, following the public \\nconsultation, the structure of the guidelines has been \\nrevise d to better reflect this focus . The cross-references \\nto the EBA Guidelines on internal governance \\n(EBA/GL/2017/11) added to paragraphs  10 and 11 are \\nintended to incorporate in these guidelines governance \\nrequirements that are (objectively) valid for the \\npurposes of these guidelines.  \\nThe g uidelines have been revised and now do not \\nassign specific roles to each of the three  lines of \\ndefence  but describe the responsibilities of each. \\nFurthermore, the revised guidelines do not explicitly \\nrequire the establish ment of  an information securit y \\nfunction, with the responsibilities assigned to a \\ndesignated person, but a reference to the information \\nsecurity function is made in the background section.  \\nBased on the feedback received, paragraphs  32 and 33designated person, but a reference to the information \\nsecurity function is made in the background section.  \\nBased on the feedback received, paragraphs  32 and 33 \\nhave been removed.

The second change is \\nbecause it is considered to be too prescriptive t o impose a specific \\noperational or organisational model , given that these may vary \\nsignificantly across financial institutions. The respondents then \\nproposed that if the phrase ‘where the three lines of defence model is \\napplied, this function should be the  second line of defence function — \\nsee Section  4.3.1 ’ is not deleted, clarification should  be made of the new \\nrole of the information security function in relation to the other second \\nlevel of defence roles.  \\nAnother respondent requested that the requiremen ts in the guidelines \\n(and specifically paragraph  32), for an information security function \\nshould focus on its required level of independence rather than on the \\norganisational structure of the financial institution.  One respondent \\nrequested clarification o f the reference to ‘… this function should be the \\nsecond line of defence function ’. The respondent commented that the \\ninformation security function, in the best case, could be part of the \\nsecond line of defence but is not the only component of the second line \\nof defence. The respondent also asked  if the operational day -to-day \\nactivities r elated to information security would be part of the first line \\nof defence . In addition, the respondent requested clarification of what \\nperson (the CISO?) was referenced in ‘…with the responsibilities \\nassigned to a designated person ’? \\nAnother respondent pro posed that the control function should monitor \\nand control the information security function and hence that this person \\nmust be located independently of the control function.  revised to ensure the appropriate segregation of ICT \\noperations, and control and internal audit functions.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nReference to the information security function in the \\nguidelines has been removed.

For instance, awareness and training, \\nrisk monitoring controls and reporting are first -line tasks. The second \\nline can complement these through independent monitoring, control \\nand assurance reviews, but it should not diffuse the responsibility of the \\nfirst line in these areas. Another way to put this is that the second line \\nof defence should perform its required activities also in the risk area of \\nICT and sec urity risk.  revised to ensure the appropriate segregation of ICT \\noperations and of control and internal audit functions.  \\nThe EBA considers that the control function should not \\ncarry out any internal  audit, whereas different kind s of \\nsecurity reviews (penetration testing , etc.) are not \\nmeant here.  \\n \\n \\nBased on the feedback received, paragraphs  32 and 33 \\nhave been removed.

It should be clarified that, with the appointment of an \\ninformation security officer, the information s ecurity function is \\nestablished. According to proportionality it may be necessary for the \\ninformation security officer to have a team , but this should be a \\nquestion of size and the level of risk exposure of the individual financial \\ninstitution.

For example, in their view, the activity in \\nparagraph  33(d) belongs to the first line of defence (operational \\nmanagement) and is not the responsibility of the informatio n security \\nfunction. The respondent suggested adjusting the wording of this \\nparagraph  to ensure that third party adherence to security \\nrequirements is not difficult/ infeasible to enforce.  \\nAnother respondent suggest ed adding a new paragraph  33(f) ‘Be \\ninvolved in all ICT initiatives and projects from their early stages ’.

Furthermore , it recommend prescribing the goals \\ninstead of the activities in this paragraph . \\nOne respondent noted that the chapter starts with an ambition to \\n‘identify potenti al vulnerabilities ’ but then continues to describe a set \\nof best practices for ICT security. It recommended that there must be a \\nclearer connection between the identification of the potential \\nvulnerabilities and the actions that must be taken as a conseque nce of \\nthe identified potential vulnerabilities.  \\nAnother respondent found the list too prescriptive and suggested the \\nrevised wording: ‘These procedures, following a risk -based approach,  \\nshould could  include, for example , the following measures ’. Another \\nrespondent provided suggested wording for paragraph  39, specifically: \\n‘Financial institutions should implement procedures to prevent the \\noccurrence of security issues , particularly in critical  ICT systems and ICT \\nservices and should minimise their impact on ICT service delivery. ’  The goal of these measures is the prevention of security \\nissues in ICT systems and ICT services and minimising \\ntheir impact on ICT serve delivery. Therefore, a chang e \\nas suggested is not deemed necessary.  \\nThe EBA would like to highlight that this paragraph \\ndescribes measures for implementing procedures to \\nprevent the occurrence of security issues in ICT systems \\nand ICT services. Therefore, the EBA sees the listed \\nmeasures as appropriate to accomplish these \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nThe EBA does not consider the list as examples but as \\nnecessary measures.  \\n \\nDue to the interconnectedness of all ICT systems and \\nICT services, there is a need to observe all security \\nissues.

Suggested wording: ‘a) \\nevaluate and remediate vulnerabilities by ensuring software and \\nfirmware are up to date, including the software provided by financial \\ninstitutions to its internal and external users, by deploying critical \\nsecurity patches or by implementing compensating controls ’. Their \\nview was that currently the wording in paragraph  39(a) on the desired \\noutcome to ‘identify potential vulnerabilities ’ that starts this section is Vulnerabilities have to be identified before they can be \\nevaluated and remediated ; therefore , the EBA \\nconsiders that no change is needed.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nNo change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 81 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nnot addressed in the text that follows.

Instead, there should be a framework in \\nplace that defines the level or type of security baseline for any given \\nnetwork device, in a risk -based mann er. Suggested wording: ‘b) secure \\nconfiguration baselines of all network components such as core routers \\nor switches should be implemented in a risk -based manner; ’ \\nAnother respondent considered that secure configuration baselines \\nshould be established not only for critical network components, but also \\nfor system components (servers, databases, etc.). Therefore, they \\nproposed adding the following reference: ‘Secure configuration \\nbaselines of critical network components […] and system components, \\nsuch as serv ers and databases ’.

Another general \\ncomment was on the fact that the guid elines do not include minimum \\nKPIs for ISMS s, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council  \\n(FFIEC ) principles for outsourcing and more specific requirements for \\nadequate vulnerability/patch management and network segmentation. \\nAs a consequence, i nstitutions do not know what is useful and what the \\nauditor will demand. In contrast to this, the number of pen etration tests \\nis deemed too high. If tests for the effectiveness of the security \\nmeasures are required after major changes, information security  \\nincidents  and the installation of new internet -facing systems and once \\nper year for critical and every 3 year s for other applications, the \\ninformation security  organisation  will spend most of its budget on \\npenetration tests and will lose the support of the company in following \\nup. The respondent recommends that it would be better to use the \\nFFIEC wording in the I CT Examination Handbook: ‘frequency and scope \\nof a penetration test should be … determined by the risk assessment \\nprocess. ’  The EBA considers t hat a financial institution itself is \\nresponsible for their risk assessment and needs to have \\nan understanding of what is useful for their situation.  \\nThe guidelines do not consider that penetration tests \\nand red team exercises should be mandatory , as testi ng \\nshould be proportionate, commensurate to the risk \\nexposure of the institution and to the maturity of ICT \\nand security risk management within the organisation. \\nThe guidelines are clarified by replacing ‘foster ’ with \\n‘consider good practices such as ’. \\n \\n No change . \\n \\n \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\n \\nParagraph  44 One comment was received that the institution should foster source \\ncode reviews, penetration tests and/or red team exercises.

The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .  \\nParagraph  44 One respondent suggested that some of the terms in this section should \\nbe defined in the ‘Definitions ’ section  (e.g. red team) and some other \\nrelated terms should be also used here for the sake of inclusiveness, for \\nexample ‘vulnerability assessment ’ and ‘blue teaming ’ (together with \\n‘purple teaming ’). Additional wording proposed: ‘Furthermore, the \\ninstitution should foster source code reviews, vulnerability assessments, \\npenetration tests, or blue team - red team (or purple team)  exercises. ’  The suggestion is partly accommodated to include \\n‘vulnerability assessment ’: ‘Furthermore, the \\ninstitution should consider good practices such as \\nsource code reviews, vulnerability assessments , \\npenetration test and red team exercises. ’ \\n The guidelines \\nhave  been \\namended . \\nParagraph  45 One respondent suggested deleting the word ‘new ’: ‘and ensure that \\nthis framework considers new  threats and vulnerabilities ’, while \\nanother suggested substituting ‘new threats ’ with  ‘identified threats ’. \\nAnother respondent asked for clarification of whether  this paragraph  \\nintroduces a separate framework.

Additional wording proposed: ‘are carried out by independent \\n(external or internal)  testers .’  \\n  \\n \\n \\nParagraph  47 One comment was received to add the word ‘critical ’ to better reflect \\nthe proportionality principle , i.e. that minor or low -risk changes to non -\\ncritical or low -risk processes, infrastructure or systems might not need \\nsecurity testing , depending on the type of risks associated with the \\nchange (risk -based approach): ‘Financial institutions …  in the event of \\nchanges to critical  infrastructure, processes  ….’  The proportionality pri nciple is already sufficiently \\nincluded in the wording of ‘tests of security measures \\nare conducted ’.

The EBA agrees with the proposal. The guidelines have \\nbeen amended accordingly.  The guideline s \\nhave been \\namended.  \\nParagraph  48 One respondent proposed changes to allow flexibility in handling \\nweaknesses that are exposed by security test s and should have the \\nflexibility to decide to defer updating a critical system to its next release, \\nas an updat e might introduce more risk than does the risk of not fixing \\nthe weakness. Furthermore , management could be willing to accept the \\nrisk of not implementing a security measure …: ‘Financial institutions \\nshould continuously monitor and evaluate results of the  security tests, \\nand update their security measures on a risk -based approach  \\naccordingly. without undue delays in case of critical ICT systems. A risk \\ntreatment plan should be established including necessary \\ncompensative controls, in order to reduce risk, when patching is not \\nan option. ’   The EBA considers that the obligation to patch cannot \\nbe removed in  the case of a critical system. There is a \\ntiming aspect of ‘when do you patch ’, but if this causes \\na big delay,  the institution should have more robust \\nsystems or methods of patch deployment.  \\n \\nThe EBA considers that risk -based approach is included \\nby the word  ‘accordingly ’. \\n  \\nNo change . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 88 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nParagraph  49 A comment was received on how to define criticality of  systems and for \\nthe EBA to clarify that the expectation is for firms to demonstrate having \\nadequate processes for determining criticality and an appropriate \\nprocess for action on this basis.  \\nA number of comments were received regarding the testing frequen cy \\nof 3  years. Some respondents suggested that the timing of ‘every \\n3 years ’ should be deleted since this paragraph already provides for a \\nrisk-based approach, so there is no need to be more prescriptive.  \\nAnother respondent considered that testing all the critical security \\nmeasures on an annual basis and all non -critical systems every 3  years \\ncan be too much for complex organisations  and that these requirements \\nshould be adapted to the kind of organisation  we are talking about. \\nOther respondents considered that the period of 3 years is a long span \\nof time and that tests for all critical ICT systems should be performed at \\nleast on an annual basis, i.e. based on the asset classification process \\npreviously mentioned.  In 3 years , technology revolutions happen an d \\nattack vectors evolve in impressive ways.  \\nA third view was that new wording should be added to ensure that the \\ntiming for testing is risk based and the responsibility of the institution : \\n‘Financial institutions should perform on -going and repeated tests of \\nthe security measures , commensurate with the criticality of the ICT \\nsystems. ’ For all critical ICT systems (paragraph  18), these tests shall be \\nperformed at least on an annual basis. Non -critical systems should be \\ntested regularly on a risk -based approa ch, but at least every three \\nyears .’ \\nOne respondent also suggested that the scope be deleted (i.e. not to \\nspecify ‘non-critical systems ’). This respondent commented that \\npenetration testing is conducted on all external -facing applications \\nbefore going live, annually, and when there are material changes to \\nthese applications. They test external -facing applications because these See comment on paragraph  18 above  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe EBA considers that conducting tests on a risk -based \\napproach but at least every 3 years is critical to ensure \\neffective ICT and security risk management. Testing \\nsystems less frequently than every 3 years may result  in \\nsecurity measures being obsolete.  \\n \\n \\n \\nThe EBA considers that a financial institution has to \\nconduct its own risk assessment and conduct the tests \\naccordingly. However, it is important to ensure that \\ntests are conducted repeatedly, but not less frequentl y \\nthan every 3 years.  \\n \\n \\n \\nThe EBA considers that implementing these \\nsuggestions would be unduly burdensome and not be \\nprinciple based .

The EBA considers the current wording of the guideline \\nto be sufficient, as it is in line with the relevant \\nregulation.  No change . \\nParagraph  50 One respondent suggested that it seems that the requirement does not \\ntake into account the current trends in payment services technology. \\nParagraph  50 requires all PSPs to test security measures implemented \\nin payment terminals and devices used to provide payment services, \\npayment terminals and devices used to authenticate the user of \\npayment services and devices and software supplied by the payment \\nservice provider to the u ser of the payment service to enable the user \\nto generate/receive an authentication code. In the case of mobile \\ndevices, such as smartphones  and tablets, the requirement to test each \\ndevice model is not unrealistic, but it may be considered excessively \\nburdensome. Therefore, testing could be restricted to a limited range of \\nmodels, reducing the potential choice of compliant mobile devices. It is \\nsuggested that the requirement to test mobile devices (smartphones, \\ntablets, etc.) be limited to the testing of t he operating system only (e.g. \\nAndroid, iOS, Windows Mobile).   The EBA is of the view that, as a rule, PSPs should enter \\ninto contract s with their outsourcing providers for the \\nprovision of payment services. Any form of contract \\nshould be concluded between  the PSP and its \\noutsourcer, not with the PSU. The EBA is aware that in \\nsome cases PSPs may not have a close relation ship with \\nsub-outsourcing providers because the whole process \\nis under the control of the primary outsourcing \\nprovider. The EBA is also awa re that PSPs might not \\nenter into contracts with suppliers of end user devices , \\nsuch as tablets or smartphones , or providers of \\noperating systems.

One respondent made the proposal for the additional wording:  \\n‘Financial institutions should ensure that staff members occupying key \\nroles and main ICT risk -handling functions (e.g. ICT operations staff, \\nICT in-house development staff and ICT security management staff) \\nreceive targeted information security training at least ann ually with \\nmandatory examinations .’  The EBA merged a few paragraphs in Section  3.4.8 and \\nredrafted the guidelines to require that institutions \\nshould ‘establish a training programme, including \\nperiodic security awareness programmes , for all staff \\nand contractors  to ensure that they are trained to \\nperform their duties and responsibilities consistent with \\nthe relevant security policies and procedures to reduce \\nhuman error, theft, fraud, misuse or loss and trained  to \\naddress information security -related r isks.

Financial \\ninstitutions should ensure that t he performance of their ICT operations \\nis aligned with the business requirements. ’ Another respondent \\nsuggested remov ing the requirement for automation and to add \\n‘consider where automation of ICT operations may provide material \\nbenefit in the minimisation  of potential errors arising from the \\nexecution of manual tasks .’ The guidelines intend to show that manual tasks may \\ncause errors. However , it is also clear that automation \\nmay indeed be one of a number of ways of increasing \\neffectiveness ; therefore , the wording is amended to \\nreflect this: ‘Financial institutions should maintain and \\nimprove , when possible , the efficiency of their ICT \\noperations, including but not limited to the need to \\nconsider how to minimise potential errors arising from \\nthe execution of  manual tasks ’. \\n‘To increase the efficiency of financial institutions ’ ICT \\noperations, financial institutions should, as far as \\npossible, automate ICT operations (e.g. job scheduling \\nprocesses, monitoring of ICT systems, maintenance and \\nrepair of financial institutions ’ assets, shift handover) to \\nminimise potential errors ar ising from the execution of \\nmanual tasks.

The respondent recognised the benefits of ICT \\noperations capacity monitoring and performance management ; \\nhowever, the implementation of such program mes for financial service \\nfirms operating globally is often costly, complex and may not deliver \\nimmediately the benefits expected. For example, the logging and \\nmonitoring of procedures for critical ICT operations may not increase \\noperational efficiency if not implemented appropriately.  The commen t has been accommodated in revised \\nparagraph  53 (see comment above), and examples \\nhave been removed.  \\nWith regard to paragraph  57 (revised paragraph  54), \\nthe EBA considers that logging and monitoring \\nrequirements are important and need to be in place. \\nHowev er, the manner and extent to which they are \\nimplemented is decided upon by institutions \\nproportionately .  The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\n \\nNo change . \\nParagraph  58 One respondent suggested that this requirement should also depend on \\nprotection needs and the business criticality of the process and/or asset  \\n— only for the critical assets of the bank and only for the key \\ncomponents. The a dditional wording suggested  is ‘Financial institutions \\nshould maintain an updated inventory of their  critical  ICT assets \\n(including the core  ICT systems, network devices, databases).  \\nAnother respondent suggested identifying assets that are ‘critical ’ in \\nproviding service capability.  The inventory should contain all assets , which then \\nneed to be classified for cri ticality. Maintaining an \\ninventory of only critical assets risks omitting assets \\nthat were not correctly classified.  No change . \\nParagraph  58 One respondent requested clarification of the objective behind a \\nrequirement to have a single system to carry this  information, as the \\ngoal of enabling a proper configuration and change management \\nprocess can be achieved in other ways, including by using a suite of \\ntools. The respondent acknowledged and agreed that financial \\ninstitutions should maintain up -to-date inv entor ies of ICT assets. \\nHowever, it considered that the requirement in this section should \\nspecify desired outcomes rather than specific features of an asset \\nmanagement system. Financial institutions that maintain very large \\nsystems may choose to keep asse t, configuration, change and Paragraph  58 (revised paragraph  53) does not require a \\nfinancial institution to keep the inventory  in a single \\nsystem.

The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nParagraph s 58 \\nand 59  One respondent suggested that clarification was needed on the extent \\nto which financial institutions have to document interdependencies \\nbetween the different ICT assets.  \\nOne respondent suggested specifying the desired outcomes in asset, \\nconfiguration or change management , to which ICT professionals can \\nadhere using verifiable and commercially reasonable means. Th e \\nrespondent argued that , while it is reasonable to require ICT \\nprofessionals to understand the components and/or systems on which \\nan application or system depends, this is not true in the opposite \\ndirection. For example, while the operating system version  on which a \\nparticular application relies is an important dependency to understand, \\nit would not be practical for an operating system vendor to know all of \\nthe software packages that may at some point run on that operating \\nsystem.  The EBA considers that providing more detailed \\nrecommendations on the level of details or specific \\nsolutions would make the guidelines less practical and \\nmore burdensome. The intention is to remain principle  \\nbased , to allow their  proportionate implementati on.

No change . \\nParagraph s 62 \\nand 63  Two respondents recommended that the guidelines remain principle \\nbased in how firms decide to implement data and ICT systems backups \\nand restoration procedures and to remove prescriptive requirements \\non how firms achieve this outcome.  \\nOne respondent suggested that backup requirements should  be aligned \\nto the business recovery requirements. System criticality is more \\naligned to the BIA for technology in business continuity management.  \\nAnother respondent recognised the benefits of ICT systems and data \\nbackups and restoration. However, it sugge sted that further \\nconsiderations may be required (e.g. impact tolerance levels, firms risk \\nappetite).  These guidelines requires financial institutions to \\ndefine their backup and recovery processes \\nrequirements , in line with business recovery \\nrequirements a nd the criticality of the data and the ICT \\nsystems. However, the EBA does not specify how this \\nshould be achieved. Hence, the EBA has defined \\nprinciples rather than specific requirements.  \\nThe EBA specifically mentioned that backup \\nrequirements are defined in line with business recovery \\nrequirements and the criticality of the data and the ICT \\nsystems.

With regard to the remote location, it should \\nbe in such a location that it is not exposed to the s ame \\nrisks as the primary site.

ICT \\nincident and \\nproblem \\nmanagement  One respondent commented that the implementation of requirements \\nin paragraphs  64 and 65 seems to align with the requirements detailed \\nin the BIS BCBS ’s ‘Principles for the sound management of operational \\nrisk’9 regarding ‘loss data collection ’ (page  11), and recommend \\nconsider ing adding a reference to this document, as it would help  clarify \\nand trace requirements to their potential source.  The EBA considers that the objectives of loss data \\ncollection and incident and problem management are \\ndifferent.  No change . \\nParagraph  64 One respondent commented that this description was primaril y focused \\non the aim of incident management. Since Section  4.5.1 was meant for \\nincident and problem management , the  respondent suggested \\nprovid ing additional wording : ‘The primary objectives of problem \\nmanagement are to prevent incidents  […] (proactive  problem \\nmanagement). ’ The EBA considers that the primary objective is to \\nenable financial institutions to continue or resume \\ncritical business functions and processes when \\ndisruptions occur.

The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nParagraph  64 One respondent asked for the guidelines  to specify and provide \\nexamples of which incidents are considered security incidents and \\nwhich are considered another type of ICT incident.  \\n \\nOne respondent expected financial institut ions to have criteria in place \\nfor (1) operation al incidents,  (2) security incidents , and (3) early warning \\nindicators.  The guidelines focus on operational and security \\nincidents that are described in the definitions section of \\nthese guidelines.  \\nEarly warning indicators are part of the problem \\nidentification process and the way in which the \\nproblem identification process is implemented may \\nvary between  institution s; therefore , any further \\ndetails would be disproportionate and burdensome.  No change . \\n \\n \\nNo change . \\n \\nParagraph  65 One respondent welcomed the principle -based guidance on resumption \\nof service in the  event of a disruption but recommended considering \\nseparating out the list of activities that firms should consider in their \\nincident and prob lem management as examples of how the \\nrequirements could apply or be interpreted.  As the guidelines follow a principle -based approach, \\nproviding more specific requirements would not be \\npractical and proportionate.  No change . \\nParagraph  65(a\\n) One respondent  suggested that , for internal products/services, there is \\nsometimes no SLA available, so this cannot be used as a benchmark. The \\ncriticality rating is present in every case. The c hange in wording \\nsuggested  is ‘business criticality and or service agreements ’ The comment has been accommodated. Service level \\nagreements are not the driver to decide the priority of \\nan incident , as this priority should be based on business \\ncriticality assessment s. Reference to ‘service \\nagreements ’ is removed.  The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nParagraph  65(c) Two respondents commented that security incidents outside the \\norganisation are not part of an institution ’s own incident management. \\nA financial institution is unlikely to be able to act to ‘identify, consider \\nand resolve ’ problems external to its organisation. The present wording \\ncould be misunderstood to mean that incidents within other \\norganisations would also have to be considered.  The EBA considers that it is important to take account \\nof incidents affecting a financial institution that have \\noccurred outside, for example at a service provider. The \\nways in which to avoid recurrence of incidents, \\nhowever, are in the control of an institution. The text of \\nthe guidelines ha s been revised to pro vide more clarity: \\n‘should analyse operational or security incidents likely  The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 99 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nThe s uggested change s in wording  are ‘within and/or  outside  the \\norganisation ’ and ‘financ ial institutions should analyse operational or \\nsecurity incidents that have been identified or have occurred within \\nand/or outside the organisation .’  to affect the financial institution  that have been \\nidentified or have occurred within and/or outside the \\norganisation […]’. \\nParagraph  65(f)  One respondent suggested further considering the impact on firms \\noperating across multiple jurisdictions of having to comply with multiple \\nrequirements or reporting obligations. There is an increasing risk of the \\nproliferation of incident reporting require ments for firms, which may \\nincrease the reporting burden on firms, as well as divert resources from \\nactual risk mitigation. The respondent suggested that the EBA should \\nconsider how to support efficient reporting mechanisms, such as \\n‘provide once, satisfy many ’, or how reporting information could be \\naggregated by authorities and shared with industry to support \\npreparedness and response. The respondent was supportive of an \\neffective and coordinated incident response plan that would support \\nthe industry in th e event of a large -scale disruption, which may require \\ninput and testing with the public sector ’s response (e.g. an EU \\nblueprint).  The EBA is aware of the need for multiple submissions \\nacross jurisdictions ; however , such a proposal is outside \\nthe scope of the guidelines. Moreover, the EBA has \\nflagged this issue to the European Commission in its \\nJoint ESA advice on the need for legislative \\nimprovements on ICT risk management requirements \\n(JC 2019  26). No change . \\nParagraph  65(f)  One respondent proposed addi ng the word s ‘and internal ’. The \\nsuggested wording  is ‘specific external and internal communication \\nplans ’.

ICT project \\nand change \\nmanagement  \\nAgile principle  Many respondents suggested that Section  4.6, ‘ICT project and change \\nmanagement ’, should be redesigned to allow modern project \\nmanagement practices to be used for system /application development \\n(e.g. Agile, Tribes).  \\nIt was suggested to focus more on what i s to be achieved (control \\nprinciples) and less on how this should be achieved. Draft requirements \\ncould be perceived to dictate that project management and system \\ndevelopment methodologies should follow the waterfall model, i.e. a \\nlinear sequential design approach for software development. Most \\nfinancial institutions have already or are in the process of adopting agile \\nsoftware development. This is another example of these guidelines \\nlimiting the options available for financial institutions, in this case no t \\nonly related to risk management but also to business development.  \\nOne respondent proposed amend ing this section in such a way that it \\nfacilitates agile working in ICT development projects. Financial \\ninstitutions have increasingly adopted agile way s of wo rking in the \\ndevelopment of software. This means that the requirements described \\nin paragraph  73, which envisage  that the process of the development of \\nICT systems should include a), b), c)  and d), cannot be met by the \\nfinancial institutions that use agile methods. In competitive \\nenvironments , the need for flexibility, especially with the limited \\nseparation of duties and new ways of organis ing projects, is seen as \\nmandatory.  \\nThe iterative approa ch of ‘agile ’ methods  supports a product rather \\nthan a project mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the The EBA has updated all of Section  3.6 to make it more \\nprinciple  based and technology neutral.  \\nThe EBA defined the desired outcomes of these \\nguidelines and the principles that institutions can apply \\nto achieve these outcomes. The guidelines do not seek \\nto define specific ways in which the outcomes  can be \\nachieved , and it is up to institutions to decide how best \\nto apply these principles. The EBA applied the principle \\nof proportionality throughout the text and focused on \\ncreating technology agnostic and future proof \\nguidance. Hence, the EBA does not specify what \\nsoftware d evelopment methodology is to be used nor \\nwhat specific standards or technology are to be applied. \\nThe executive summary has been amended to include \\nthe following sentence:  ‘These guidelines intend to be \\ntechnology and methodology agnostic .’ \\nBased  on the suggestion, the paragraph has been \\nrevised and prescriptive elements removed. Instead , \\nthe guidelines now require that  ‘This process should be \\ndesigned using a risk -based approach.

The respondent \\nconsidered that some requirements of the draft guidelines are \\nexpendable and not fit for purpose. In particular, where the guidelines \\noutline the implementation of ICT -related changes primarily through a \\nproject setup, there is a lack of insight on state -of-the-art ICT challenges. \\nThe respondent considered that the draft guideline s focused too \\nstrongly on project setup, which did not fit the actual practice in, among \\nother  thing s, software development. Software is increasingly being \\ndeveloped continuously or in agile project setups (e.g. S crum ) rather \\nthan in so -called ‘waterfall ’ project setups (as particularly indicated in \\nparagraph  68 of th e draft guidelines).  \\nAnother respondent advised adding a provision in Section  4.6 on the use \\nof control mechanisms , regardless of the methodology employed.  \\nOne respondent suggested the possibility of includ ing the draft \\nguideline s on ICT project management  (i.e. Section  4.6.1)  as general \\nrequirements for, for example,  project and change management, into \\nthe Guidelines on internal governance under Directive  2013/36/EU \\n(EBA/GL/2017/11).

No change . \\nGeneral 4.6  One respondent suggested includ ing provisions associated with risk \\nmanagement, since it must be an inherent part of changes, acquisitions, \\nnew developments, projects, etc., to enable the ‘security by design and \\nby default ’ paradigm.  In these  guidelines , Sectio n 3.4.4 on ICT operation s \\nsecurity requires institutions on an ongoing basis to \\ndetermine whether changes in the existing operational \\nenvironment influence the existing security measures \\nor require the adoption of additional measures to \\nmitigate related risks appropriately.

ICT \\nproject \\nmanagement  One respondent suggested that Section  4.6.1 on ICT project \\nmanagement should be  removed , as it is too high level and, to a large \\nextent, is a repetition of more specific and concrete requirements \\ncovered elsewhere. The guidelines already required institutions to \\nassess risks in major ICT changes ( Section  4.6.3 : ICT change \\nmanagement ; Section  4.3.1 , item 15: identify and assess ICT risks \\nresulting from major change ; Section  4.3.3 , item 21: ICT risk assessment \\nto be performed annually or on any major changes).  Section  3.6.1 defines important principles related to \\nproject management. Although the re are some \\nreferences to this process in other sections of the \\nguidelines , it is important to keep this section to ensure \\nthat a holistic set of principles is defined.

The respondent agreed and acknowledged that source code \\nintegrity was critical to the success of any ICT  system , but noted that \\nmany of the system components require specialised knowledge and \\nmay be intellectual property.  The EBA considers that the main purpose of this \\nparagraph is to ensure the transfer of knowledge from \\ndeparting employees.

No change . \\nParagraph  80 One respondent requested clarity on the desired outcome of this \\nmeasure. The respondent said that financial institutions ’ processes for \\nacquisition and development of ICT systems should not necessarily \\napply to systems developed outside the organisation s. For instance, if \\ntelephone systems are outsourced to a provider, the ICT function should \\nmanage the performance of the ou tsourced telecommunications \\nservice through  an SLA and understand the risks and controls \\nsurrounding this outsourcing.  The desired outcome of this paragraph  is to ensure that \\nICT systems managed outside the ICT organisation are \\nsubject to the same controls as those managed by the \\nICT organisation.  \\nThe EBA is of the view that, as a rule, PSPs should enter \\ninto a contract with their outsourcing providers for  the \\nprovision of payment services. Any form of contract \\nshould be concluded between the PSP and its \\noutsourcer, not with the PSU. The EBA is aware that in \\nsome cases PSPs may not have close a relation with \\nsub-outsourcing providers because the whole process \\nis under the control of the primary outsourcing \\nproviders.

This means that it is up to an \\ninstitution to define the process applicable for the \\nmanagement of the business -managed applications \\nbased on the risk and criticality of these systems.

ICT \\nchange \\nmanagement  One respondent suggested adding a comment regarding the ‘post -\\nimplementation review ’, which should give assurance that the change \\nimplementation has been done successfully without unexpected \\nimpacts. Based on a risk assessment, a ‘post -implementation revie w’ \\nmay be required for new implementations as well as for changes to \\nimplementation s. The suggestion was also made for this section to \\nmention proper change documentation, control and approval.  The EBA has updated the text in this paragraph to be \\nmore pri nciple based, removing specific requirements \\nof certain elements of the change management process \\nto ensure that financial institutions focus on outcomes \\nof the change management process and have sufficient \\nflexibility to achieves these outcomes.  \\nFurthermo re, the incident and problem management \\nprocess will provide additional assurance if the \\nimplementation is not successful.

This would ensure \\nthat the guidelines are focused on ICT risks and would avoid inconsis tent \\nor duplicative requirements.  The EBA considers that ICT is an essential part of \\nbusiness continuity management and that it would be \\ncounterproductive not to include business continuity \\nmanagement in the context of the overall objectives of \\nthese guidelines. Furthermore , this is necessary for \\ninstitutions within the scope of PSD2 that are not with in \\nthe scope of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance \\n(EBA /GL/2017/11).

In some cases , however , \\nthe complexity of a financial institution is taken into account and at \\nother times the requirements for the content of plans (BCP and recovery \\nplans) are much too detailed. This will lead to plans that are \\nunmanageable, unmaintainable and practically not usable.  The EBA considers that the level of detail in the \\nguidelines is sufficiently practical to achieve the desired \\noutcomes whil e providing institutions with the \\nflexibility to do so.  No change . \\nGeneral \\nclarification  One respondent suggested that the implementation of requirements in \\nparagraph s 83 to 97 seems to align with the requirements detailed in \\nBIS BCBS ’s ‘Principles for the sound management of operational risk’ \\nregarding ‘business resiliency and continuity: Principle  10’, and \\nrecommended refer ring to this document, as it would help clarify and \\ntrace requirements to their potential source.  The EBA agrees that ICT and security risk management \\nis a subset of operational risk; however , adding \\nreference to it in the guidelines would create confusion.  No change . \\nBCM is treated \\nas a subset of \\nICT \\n Two respondents stated that it was unclear why BCM is treated as a \\nsubset of ICT risk. One respondent commented that this may lead to a \\nnew layer of requirements as opposed to business continuity planning \\nfor business as a whole, and risks confusion, mixed  control standards \\nand the potential duplication of effort with no material benefit.  \\nThe approach in the guidelines diverges from the emerging approaches \\nand supervisory focus on end -to-end service availability and \\naccountability at the service level.  \\nAnot her respondent recommended reconsidering the inclusion of the \\nBCM elements outlined in this section to avoid introducing unnecessary \\ncomplexity to institutions and a potentially siloed approach to BCM. By \\nsetting specific requirements for one function (i.e . ICT), at the expense \\nof all other functions, the guidelines would undermine this emerging \\napproach. They would create a discrete and additional layer of BCM \\nrequirements specifically for ICT, as opposed to the business as a whole.  BCM is not a subset of ICT and security risk. However, \\nin the context of these guidelines , BCM is an important \\nconcept for the mitigation of ICT and security risks.  \\nOn completely separating BCP from business, the EBA ’s \\nview is that it would be counterproductive to separate \\nICT from the rest of the business proces s; thus , these \\nare considered where relevant (see comment on \\nSection  3.7).  \\nThe EBA updated the e xecutive summary with the \\nfollowing clarification with regard to Section  3.7: \\n‘Section  3.7 specifies expectations with regard to \\nbusiness continuity management and developing \\nresponse and recovery plans, including testing, and \\ntheir consequent updat ing based on the testing results. \\nFinancial institutions should ensure that they have \\neffectiv e crisis communication measures in place so  \\nThe guidelines \\nhave been \\namended.FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 116 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nIt argued that this sec tion of the guidelines varies from providing very \\nspecific guidance for ICT functions to providing more strategic \\nrequirements for an institution ’s overall BCM.  \\nThe respondent said that the guidance applies a narrow lens to BCM, \\nwhich may deflect focus fro m other, equally important, impact types \\nand that effective assurance for large global banks relies on an approach \\nthat can be consistently applied across all business divisions and \\njurisdictions.  that all relevant internal and external stakeholders can \\nbe informed in a timely manner. ‘The ICT business \\ncontinuity management processes are an integral part \\nof the overall institution ’s business continuity \\nman agement process and should not be separated .’ \\n \\n \\nParagraph  83 One respondent suggested that this could refer to the preparation \\nphase of BCM when high-availability solutions (e.g. redundancy, data \\nmirroring) can minimise  the probability of an ICT system and/or service \\noutage. This ‘going concern ’ approach should be given at least as much \\nemphasis  in the BCM process as is given to those preparations that \\nactivate after the ICT disaster happens ( ‘gone concern ’), where truly the \\nmain concern s are limiting losses, disaster containment and making the \\nsystems operable again.  The EBA considers that this paragraph  is relevant to \\nBCM, where as the processes defined in the other parts \\nof the guidelines (e.g. risk management, change \\nmanagement, information security  and vendor \\nmanagement) ultimately support a financial \\ninstitution ’s operational resilience, including ICT.  No change . \\n4.7. (including \\nparagraphs  93 \\nto 95)  One respondent proposed that , although financial market \\ninfrastructures (FMIs) are a subset of the bank ’s interdependencies, \\nSection  4.7 (including paragraphs  93 to 95) should caveat the guidelines \\nwith an appropriate qualifying statement to exempt banks from the \\nresponsibility of FMIs ’ business continuity plann ing and ongoing BCM \\ngovernance. The respondent explained that financial institutions are \\nreliant on third party service providers , including FMIs as payment, \\nclearing and settlement operators , to ensure continuity of services to \\nthe customer. FMIs are subject to regulatory requirements for their \\nresilience framework (such as the ECB ’s cyber resilience oversight \\nguidance for FMIs or the principles for FMIs issued by the BIS and \\nIOSCO). However, it is not always within the control of an individual \\nbank or financial institution to mandate or ensure compliance of an The EBA considers that it is the financial instit ution ’s \\nresponsibility to assess risks to its business processes, \\nincluding risks from FMIs and to design measures to \\nrecover affected business process es.

Business \\nimpact analysis  \\n One respondent noted that the principle of proportionality applies to all \\nrequirements included in the draft guidelines. A system for business \\ncontinuity management is built on a BIA, which enables the \\nidentification of cri tical processes, for which appropriate mechanisms \\nshould be in place to ensure business continuity. Depending on the scale \\nof operations and the size of the enterprise, in accordance with the \\nprinciple of proportionality, the analysis should provide inform ation on \\nthe requirements for business continuity management.  The EBA confirms that the principle of proportionality \\napplies throughout th ese guidelines.  No change . \\nParagraph  84 One respondent requested clarification on whether paragraph  84 \\nresembles paragraph  17. Paragraph  17 covers the identification of functions, \\nprocesses and assets, whereas paragraph  78 defines \\nBIAs. However, the outcomes of the analysis performed \\nin paragraph  17 can be used for the BIA in \\nparagraph  78. No change . \\nParagraph  84 One respondent suggested amending paragraph  84 in such a way that a \\nscenario analysis is not expected to be a mandatory part of a BIA. They \\ncommented that, as part of sound business continuity management, \\nfinancial institutions should conduct a BIA by means of, among other  \\nthing s, scenario analysis. They pointed out that, according to their \\nunderstanding, the scope of the BIA is to analyse a financial institution ’s \\nexposure to severe business disruptions. The impact derived from such \\ndisruptions does not change depending on the underlying scenario ( the \\nroot cause triggering the disruption). Consequently, scenario analyses \\ndo not provide added value within this context. In contrast to this, \\nscenario analyses can add value in other areas of business continui ty \\nmanagement , such  as business continuity planning, response planning \\nand testing.  The EBA considers that scenario planning is an \\neffective way to assess the impact of severe business \\ndisruptions. However, the guidelines do not limit the \\nBIA to scenario t esting only , as its main aim is to assess \\nexposure to severe business disruptions and their \\npotential impact.

Business \\ncontinuity \\nplanning  \\n One respondent suggested that the reference to disruption of business \\nservices in paragraphs  86 to 88 (e.g. ‘severe business disruption that ’) \\nappears highly aligned with the overall approach currently taken by the \\nUK authorities, and potentially the Basel Committee, on operational \\nresilience, and recommend ed consider ing a reference to operational  \\nresilience , to avoid potential inconsistencies or divergent approaches \\nbeing developed.

No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 119 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nParagraph s 86 \\nand 96  Some respondent s suggested removing any reference to prescriptive \\nactivities expected from the management body, such as the \\ndocumentation and approval of business continuity plans \\n(paragraph  86) or the requirement that identified deficiencies resulting \\nfrom tests should be analysed, addressed and reported to the \\nmanageme nt body (paragraph  96). The respondent also suggested \\nreconsidering the need for the management body to approve specific \\nrisk-type policies.  Another respondent commented that the \\nmanagement body should approve the strategy but not the specific \\nBCPs of all functions ; therefore , approval of BCPs should be done by the \\nexecutive management. One respondent proposed adding the \\ndesignation ‘documented and approved by appropriate management \\nbody  or responsible management ’, in order to cater for different \\ninternal o rganisation structures. Also the term ‘management body ’ \\nrefers to board level and BCPs are usually described at a much more \\ntechnical level than the board is used to.  The EBA considers that the approval of the business \\ncontinuity plans and the review of the results of tests \\nare consistent with the management body ’s \\nmanagement and supervisory functions as defined in \\nthe EBA Guidelines on internal governance under \\nDirective  2013/36/EU (EBA/GL/2017/11).  \\nThe management body in its supervisory function \\noversee s and challenges the management function and \\nprovides appropriate advice.  The management body \\nshould monitor, periodically review , and address any \\nweaknesses identified regarding the implementation of \\nprocesses, strategies and policies.  No change . \\nParagr aph 86 Two respondents proposed add ing the  wording ‘Besides other risks , the \\nplans should support […] ’, as BCPs cover all risks, not only ICT risks.  The risks are considered in the previous sentence , so \\nthere is no need to repeat  them . No change . \\nParagraph  86 Two respondents proposed delet ing ‘the confidentiality, integrity and \\navailability of ’. One respondent argued that the continuity plans are \\nintended to respond to unplanned interruptions of critical processes, \\nnot to incidents of confidentiality or integrity of information (the latter \\ncould  cause problems of continuity but not necessarily).  Incidents and disruptions can affect confidentiality, \\nintegrity and availability , so this should be addressed by \\nthe BCPs. Continuity is cover ed by availability.  No change . \\nParagraph  86 One respondent comment ed that disaster recovery (the ICT service \\ncontinuity) should/can be treated separately in accordance with ISO \\nstandards.  The EBA considers BCP s and disaster recovery  \\nprocesses as separate but complimenting each other. \\nThe BCP is aimed at ensuring that an institution can \\ncontinue operating, whil e the disaster recovery process  \\nis aimed at recovery activities.

No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 120 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nParagraph  86 One respondent suggested that financial institutions need to assess \\ntheir dependencies from third parties and, where necessary, analyse \\nwhether the business continuity  and disaster recovery  measures put in \\nplace by third parties satisfies/align s with the r equirements of the \\nfinancial institution s. \\nOne respondent requested that Section  4.7.2 should reflect more the \\nBCP process and its connection with third party vendors — BCPs must \\ncover this area — than the continuity related to services provided by \\nexternal parties.  Section  3.7.1 refers to the necessary considerations for \\nthe B IA, which should consider third parties as per \\nSection  3.3.2. Furthermore, more guidance on BCM \\nrelated to third party providers relationships is \\nprovided in the EBA Guidelines  on o utsourcing . \\nFor clarification, paragraph  78 has been revised to \\ninclude a reference to ‘third parties ’: ‘[…]The BIA s \\nshould also consider the criticality of the identified and \\nclassified business functions, supporting processes , \\nthird parties  and information assets, and their \\ninterdependencies , in accordance with Section  3.3.3 .’ The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nParagraph  87 One respondent commented that the RTO is an objective. If a maximum \\ntime was required, it suggested us ing the term maximum tolerable \\noutage  (MTO ). RTO is an objective, since meeting the envisaged  time \\nis never guaranteed. In addition, the term MTO is much \\nless known, and, in practice, RTO covers MTO.  \\nThe EBA has updated the text of paragraph  81 to make \\nit clearer that t he objective of the BCPs is to recover \\nprocesses within RTO:  \\n‘Financial institutions should put BCPs in place to ensure \\nthat they can react appropriately to potential failure \\nscenarios and that they are able to recover  and \\nmaintain  the operation s of their critical business \\nactivities after a disruption within a recovery time \\nobjective (RTO, the maximum time within which a \\nsystem or process must be restored after an incident) \\nand a recovery point objective (RPO, the maximum time \\nperiod during which it is acceptable for data  to be lost \\nin the event  of an incident). ’ The guidelines \\nhave been \\namended .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 121 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nParagraph  87 One respondent viewed imposing a sector critical standard  that \\nrequir ed entities to establish a specific RTO for their sector critical \\nsyste ms as impractical, technically infeasible and potentially a risk to \\nfinancial stability and a contagion risk. A more practical and feasible \\napproach is one that  focuses more broadly on resumption of service, \\nmeasured by the entity ’s best efforts to ensure the ability to safely meet \\ncontractual and regulatory service obligations.  The guidelines do not set a specific RTO value , but the \\nguidelines do require that one is established by the \\ninstitution in order to have a proportionate and \\napplicable objective fo r recovery that would involve \\nplanning for the necessary efforts for meeting \\ncontractual and regulatory service obligations.  No change . \\nParagraph  87 \\nRTO and RPO \\ndefinition  One respondent suggested that application would be facilitated and \\nconfusion avoide d by re -using established and well -known definitions \\nfrom international standards when available, e.g. the ISO  22301 \\nstandard definitions for RTO and RPO. It proposed to  (1) align the \\ndefinition of the RTO with ISO  22301: ‘The period of time following an \\nincident within which a product or service must be resumed, or activity \\nmust be resumed, or resources must be recovered. ’; and  \\n(2) align the definition of the RPO with ISO  22301: ‘The point to which \\ninformation used by an activity must be restored to enable the activity \\nto operate on resumption .’  These guidelines are technology agnostic and do not \\nspecify what specific standards or technology should be \\nused to comply with the guidelines.  \\nRTO and RPO were sufficiently defined in the Guidelines \\non ICT risk assessment under SREP. As there were no \\nchanges introduced, the EBA does not see it necessary \\nto repeat definitions provided there.  No change . \\nParagraph  87 \\n One respondent suggested to add ‘timely  maintain or restore ’ and \\n‘minimum  operation  requiremen ts’, in order to add a critical \\ncharacteristic of what BCM should ensure, which  is ensuring the \\nminimum  operation requirements for time -critical business functions if \\nthere is a  major disruption/crisis. The s uggested revised wording  is ‘and \\nthat they are able to timely  maintain  or restore  the minimum  operation \\nrequirements  of their critical business activities after a disruption within \\na recovery time objective ’. The guidelines are sufficiently proportionate to allow \\ninstitutions to decid e the best way to comply with these \\nrequirements without setting minimum requirements \\nand allowing institutions to set those timely \\noperational requirements through their RTO s and \\nRPO s. No change . \\nParagraph  87 \\n One respondent requested more explanation and examples of how \\n‘financial institutions should prioritise business continuity actions using \\na risk -based approach ’. It asked  if a previous risk assessment is needed \\nto decide which BCP to choose if several BCPs  exist depending on the \\nscenario, and if a business disruption implies the use several of them.  The prioritisation requirements will define how the \\nrecovery of business processes or systems should be \\nprioritised depending on their  criticality , for example  by \\ngiving restoration priority to the most critical and time -\\nsensitive processes.

Paragraph  81 refers to failure and d isruption , with the \\nobjective of ensur ing business continuity and disaster \\nrecovery , irrespective of the source of failure or \\ndisruption.

The \\nresponsibility for fraud scenarios lies with fraud operations.  Paragraph  82 refers to extreme but plausible scenarios, \\nincluding cyber -attacks. Institutions need to consider \\nscenarios that affect their ab ility to provide services. \\nPhishing and fraud may result in disruption (e.g. \\nphishing can spread  ransomware). Institutions need to \\nconsider how they would recover from the results of \\nthese activities.   No change . \\n4.7.3. Response \\nand recovery \\nplans  One respondent suggested that regarding the BCM measures, it should \\nbe sufficient from a host competent authority perspective that BCM \\nmeasures could also be implemented by the parent entity of a cross -\\nborder group if the parent entity is situated in an EU Mem ber State. \\nFurther more , guidance is needed with regard to BCM measures \\nprovided by parent entities in third countries. The respondent \\nsuggested aligning this with the supervisory equivalence decisions, \\nwhich allow countries recognised as equivalent to be  treated in a similar  \\nway to Member States.  Each institution should consider how BCM is \\nimplemented in their particular entity.

Testing \\nof plans  One respondent recommended c onsidering how mutual recognition of \\ntests could be achieved in order to satisfy cross -jurisdictional \\nrequirements where firms operate across jurisdictions.

No changes are required , as paragraph  88 defines what \\nneeds to be considered to update the BCP , and \\nintroducing a new term may create more confusion.  No change . \\nParagraph  95 One respondent suggested aligning the terms and concepts related to \\noperational resilience (e.g. ‘adequate set of severe but plausible testing \\nscenarios ’, ‘demonstrate ability to sustain the viability of the business \\nuntil critical operations are re -establ ished ’) with terminology proposed \\nby the UK authorities in their approach to operational resilience.

No change . \\nParagraph  95(a\\n) One respondent requested a clarification in the case of including ‘an \\nadequate set of severe but plausible testing scenarios ’. It raised a \\nquestion  of whether  if the critical functions are tested independently, \\nthat is first a critical function is recovered and then another, and so on, \\nit can it be considered to be a severe testing scenario.  An i nstitution ’s BCP planning and testing should be \\nbased on a BIA and the respective criticality assessment \\nof business processes.

The p roposed change in wording  is ‘This should  \\ncould include the switch -over of critical business functions […] ’. \\nAnother respondent suggested remov ing the second sentence, as the \\nswitch -over called for under paragraph  95(a) is impracticable and \\nharbours additional ris ks — no backup system is available for the \\nduration of testing. ‘This should include the switch -over of critical \\nbusiness functions, supporting processes and information assets to the \\ndisaster recovery environment and demonstrating that it can run them \\nfor a sufficiently representative period of time, and that it can restore \\nnormal functioning afterwards. ’ The guidelines need to set out requirements and could \\nnot provide the necessary requirement for such a test. \\nThe EBA considers that testing the switch -over of \\ncritical business functions is necessary for all \\ninstitutions , but the requirement provides sufficient \\nflexibility , as it guides institutions to perform tests in a \\ncertain way, but also allows them to use different \\nmethods to achieve the same outco me.

If the RTO time does not exceed the \\nmaximum time and the financial institution is able to recover its se rvices \\nto normal operations in their primary location, then an extra recovery \\nenvironment may not be required.  The guidelines allow that individual systems \\nredundancy is a mechanism to ensure ongoing \\nresilience, where as paragraph  89(a) refers to testing \\ndisaster recovery. Also, please note that paragraph  89 \\nmentions ‘until critical operations are re -established ’. \\nThis highlights that this is not a blanket requirement for \\neverything. The EBA considers that financial institutions \\nshould test existing infrastructure and not create \\nadditional structures.  No change . \\nParagraph  96 One respondent suggested that reporting to the management body \\nshould be confined to key aspects. The c hange in wording proposed  is \\n‘Test results should be documented and any identified main findings or  \\ndeficiencies….. ’.

Payment \\nservice user \\nrelationship \\nmanagement  One respondent commented that while the term ‘PSP’ is used \\nthroughout the guidelines, certain requirements in this section seem to \\nbe only applicable to either a credit institution or a TPP. The guidelines \\nshould theref ore specify when a requirement applies to all types of PSPs \\nand when they are directed specifically at an account servicing payment \\nservice provider (ASPSP), a payment initiation service provider (PISP) \\nand/or an a ccount information service provider (AISP) . Specific \\nreference was made to paragraphs  101 to 103, that in their view should \\nonly apply to ASPSPs. Establishing or disabling specific payment \\nfunctionalities should be initiated and processed only by these entities , The EBA considers that all guidelines should apply to all \\nPSPs so as not to  favour specific business models and to \\nensure technological neutrality. Therefore, the \\nguidelines require all security measures to be complied \\nwith by each addressee in relation to the payment \\nservices they provide , regardless of the size of the PSP \\nand t he business model followed.  \\nHowever, the guidelines are subject to the principle of \\nproportionality, set out in Section  3.1, which means No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 127 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nas this is the level at which the decision is made, i.e. \\nDirective  2015/2366/EU (PSD2) does not allow for establishing or \\ndisabling specific payment functionalities through a TPP.  that the steps that PSPs are required to take to be \\ncompliant may differ between PSPs , depending on their \\nsize and the nature, scope, complexity and riskiness of \\nthe particular service(s) they provide or intend to \\nprovide.  \\nRelationship \\nbetween the \\nTPPs and the \\nASPSPs  One respondent suggested that to make the relationship between the \\nTPPs and the ASPSPs transpar ent for PSUs , the PSU should always be \\nmade aware by TPPs that they are not acting on behalf of the ASPSP. \\nThis will help ensure stronger consumer protection , as it will allow PSUs \\nto make more informed decisions and maintain consumers ’ trust in the \\ndevelo ping payments system. In order to prevent the trust that the PSUs \\nhave in the ASPSPs from being misused, the respondent suggested that \\nSection  4.8 require the TPPs to clearly articulate to the PSUs whether or \\nnot it is acting on behalf of the ASPSP. To make such a statement \\nobvious to the PSU, it could be provided in a disclaimer when an \\ninstruction is initiated or added to the TPP ’s documentatio n or guidance \\nfor the PSU.  The EBA agrees with the comment that the PSU should \\nalways be aware of which PSP is responsible for the \\nservice in question. This concern has been reflected in \\nthe executive summary section of the guidelines: ‘The \\nEBA stresses th e importance of ensuring transparency, \\nsuch that PSUs are always aware of which PSP is \\nresponsible for providing them with the payment \\nservice. ’ The g uidelines \\nhave been \\namended . \\nSection  4.8 — \\nGeneral \\ncomment  One respondent suggested that Section  4.8 covers responsibilities that \\nare out side the scope of ICT; these are covered by operations.  This lies \\noutside the mandate of the chief information off icer. These guidelines focus on ICT and security risks as well \\nas on security risks, which can be of an operational \\nnature. Proper communication with the PSU is to be \\nseen as an important element of an integrated risk \\nmanagement approach in this context.  No change . \\nParagraph  98 \\n— Consent of a \\nPSU One respondent questioned whether  the consent of a PSU wa s required \\nto send such awareness info rmation  (campaigns, bulletins, etc.).  The EBA assumes that such consent is already included \\nin the general contractual agreements related to the \\ncorresponding payment service. It is not in the scope of \\nthese guidelines  to define any contractual \\nrequirements in this context.  No change .FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n 128 \\nComments  Summary of responses received  The EBA ’s analysis  Amendments to \\nthe proposals  \\nParagraph  100 One respondent commented that the wording ‘where product \\nfunctionality permits ’ creates an ambiguity about whether this is \\noptional or not.  \\nAnother respondent suggested that  this requirement appeared to be \\nonerous from a merchant ’s point of view and requested a clarif ication \\nof the desired outcome for this approach. For example, in many \\npayment instances a PSP was integrated into the merchant application \\nvia an API call (whit e label service) , to facilitate a simple integration into \\nthe business. The respondent noted that requirements in \\nparagraph  100 will require many businesses to rewrite applications.  As it is a requirement under these guidelines, it is not \\nto be seen as opt ional. However, it should only be \\nprovided if product functionality permits such an \\napproach. A possible use could be disabling the ability \\nto mak e foreign payments if the user wish es to . In this \\ncontext the proportionality principle set out in \\nSection  3.1 should also be considered . No change . \\nParagraph  102 One respondent recommended informing the PSU about other security -\\nrelated events as well, for example master data changes (e.g. \\ncustomer ’s phone number s, password s) and other non -transaction -\\nbased events that could help prevent fraudulent activities.  The EBA agrees in principle with the respondent. \\nHowever, the focus of these guidelines should be on \\ntransactions. This does not exclude the fact that PSPs \\nmight offer additional functionalities if considered \\nuseful.  No change . \\nParagraph s 103 \\nand 104  One respondent commented that there is no differentiation made \\nbetween PSUs that are consumers and PSUs that are corporate clients. \\nWith regard to corporate clients, PSPs could expect a more elaborate \\nknowledge and understanding of risks and threats related to payment \\nservices than  PSUs that are consumers. It should be appropriate to \\namend a risk -based approach to these provisions to enable differentia l \\ntreatment of PSUs with regard to the scope of infor mation needed.  The EBA agrees in principle with the respondent but \\nwould like to point out that , even if there is no explicit \\ndifferentiation in the wording of these guidelines, this \\ndoes not exclude a differentiation being  made in \\npractice. In this contex t the proportionality principle set \\nout in Section  3.1 should also be considered .

       "\"Here is a summary of the key points from the document:\\n\\n- The guidelines provide requirements for financial institutions on how to manage ICT and security risks. They integrate and expand upon previous guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks of payment services under PSD2.\\n\\n- The scope covers payment service providers for payment services, credit institutions for all activities, and investment firms for all activities. \\n\\n- Key areas covered include:\\n    - Governance and strategy for ICT and security risk management\\n    - Risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate ICT and security risks\\n    - Information security measures like logical security, physical security, operations security\\n    - ICT operations management \\n    - ICT project and change management\\n    - Business continuity management\\n    - Relationship management requirements for payment service users\\n\\n- The guidelines aim to be technology and methodology agnostic to allow flexibility. Implementation should be proportionate based on the institution's size, complexity and risk profile.\\n\\n- The guidelines replace and repeal the previous Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks once they take effect on 30 June 2020.\\n\\nIn summary, the document provides harmonized requirements across the EU for how financial institutions should govern and manage their ICT and security risks in a proportionate manner.\""

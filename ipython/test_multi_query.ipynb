       " Document(page_content='FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n3 \\n \\n1. Executive summary  \\nThe c omplexity of information and communication technology ( ICT) and security risks is increasing \\nand the frequency of ICT and security -related incidents (including cyber incidents) is rising , together \\nwith their potential significant adverse impact  on financial institutions ’ operational functioning. \\nMoreover, due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions , ICT and security -relate d \\nincidents risk causing potential systemic impact s. The EBA has responded to this by detailing how \\nsupervisors should cover ICT and security risk s within supervision (EBA/GL/2017/05), by detailing \\nhow financial institutions should manage outsourcing (EBA/ GL/2019/02) and by describing the \\nexpectation s for ICT and security risk management for the financial institutions in these guidelines . \\nThese guidelines set out how financial institutions  should manage the ICT and security risk s that \\nthey are exposed to. In addition, this guidance aims to provide the financial institutions to which \\nthe guidelines apply  with a better understanding of supervisory expectations for the management \\nof ICT and security risk s. \\nThese guidelines integrate  and are built on the requirements set out in the ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures for operational and security risks of payment services ’ (hereafter ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures ’), which were published in December 2017 (EBA /GL/2017/17) and which have appl ied \\nsince January 2018 in fulfilment of the mandate in Article  95(3) of Directive  2015/2366/EU (PSD2) . \\nThose guidelines were addressed to payment service providers (PSPs ), and only applied to their \\npayment services ; however , they were  in fact relevant to a broader set of institutions. For that \\nreason, these guidelines have been formulated to be addressed to a broader range of financial \\ninstitutions  under the EBA ’s remit  (namely to credit institutions wh ich already fell within  the scope \\nof the guidelines  on security measures for their payment services , but for wh ich these guidelines \\nwill now apply for all activities) and to investment firms.  These guidelines continue to apply to PSPs \\nfor the payment services they provide ; they extend to other activities o f credit institutions and also \\napply to investment firms for all activities.  Collectively, the guidelines apply to financial institutions \\nas set out in paragraph  9 under the addressees section.  \\nThe term ‘ICT and security risk s’ addresses  the operational an d security risks mandate of Article  95 \\nof the r evised Payments Services Directive (PSD2 ). This term recognises that the operational risks \\nfor payment services refer predominantly to ICT and security risk s because of the electronic nature \\nof payment services  (over ICT systems).  For this reason, these guidelines refer to ‘ICT and security \\nrisk’ instead of ‘operational and security risk’ to avoid confusion with wider operational risk issues , \\nsuch as  conduct risk, legal risk and reputational risk. Furthe rmore, security risks may stem from \\ninadequate or failed internal processes or exter nal events , but ultimately it is their  impact on \\nsystems and data that is relevant. The definition of ‘ICT and security risk ’ is based on the definition \\nin the EBA Guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory \\nreview and evaluation process and supervisory stress testing (EBA /GL/2018/03) ; thus , it \\nencompasses data integrity risk but includes additional details to clarify that it covers the impact \\nderiving from security risks.', metadata={'source': 'guidelines/Final draft Guidelines on ICT and security risk management.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

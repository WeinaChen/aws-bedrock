       " Document(page_content='FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n3 \\n \\n1. Executive summary  \\nThe c omplexity of information and communication technology ( ICT) and security risks is increasing \\nand the frequency of ICT and security -related incidents (including cyber incidents) is rising , together \\nwith their potential significant adverse impact  on financial institutions ’ operational functioning. \\nMoreover, due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions , ICT and security -relate d \\nincidents risk causing potential systemic impact s. The EBA has responded to this by detailing how \\nsupervisors should cover ICT and security risk s within supervision (EBA/GL/2017/05), by detailing \\nhow financial institutions should manage outsourcing (EBA/ GL/2019/02) and by describing the \\nexpectation s for ICT and security risk management for the financial institutions in these guidelines . \\nThese guidelines set out how financial institutions  should manage the ICT and security risk s that \\nthey are exposed to. In addition, this guidance aims to provide the financial institutions to which \\nthe guidelines apply  with a better understanding of supervisory expectations for the management \\nof ICT and security risk s. \\nThese guidelines integrate  and are built on the requirements set out in the ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures for operational and security risks of payment services ’ (hereafter ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures ’), which were published in December 2017 (EBA /GL/2017/17) and which have appl ied \\nsince January 2018 in fulfilment of the mandate in Article  95(3) of Directive  2015/2366/EU (PSD2) . \\nThose guidelines were addressed to payment service providers (PSPs ), and only applied to their \\npayment services ; however , they were  in fact relevant to a broader set of institutions. For that \\nreason, these guidelines have been formulated to be addressed to a broader range of financial \\ninstitutions  under the EBA ’s remit  (namely to credit institutions wh ich already fell within  the scope \\nof the guidelines  on security measures for their payment services , but for wh ich these guidelines \\nwill now apply for all activities) and to investment firms.  These guidelines continue to apply to PSPs \\nfor the payment services they provide ; they extend to other activities o f credit institutions and also \\napply to investment firms for all activities.  Collectively, the guidelines apply to financial institutions \\nas set out in paragraph  9 under the addressees section.  \\nThe term ‘ICT and security risk s’ addresses  the operational an d security risks mandate of Article  95 \\nof the r evised Payments Services Directive (PSD2 ). This term recognises that the operational risks \\nfor payment services refer predominantly to ICT and security risk s because of the electronic nature \\nof payment services  (over ICT systems).  For this reason, these guidelines refer to ‘ICT and security \\nrisk’ instead of ‘operational and security risk’ to avoid confusion with wider operational risk issues , \\nsuch as  conduct risk, legal risk and reputational risk. Furthe rmore, security risks may stem from \\ninadequate or failed internal processes or exter nal events , but ultimately it is their  impact on \\nsystems and data that is relevant. The definition of ‘ICT and security risk ’ is based on the definition \\nin the EBA Guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory \\nreview and evaluation process and supervisory stress testing (EBA /GL/2018/03) ; thus , it \\nencompasses data integrity risk but includes additional details to clarify that it covers the impact \\nderiving from security risks.', metadata={'source': 'guidelines/Final draft Guidelines on ICT and security risk management.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

       "  Document(page_content='FINAL REPORT  ON GUIDELINES ON ICT AND SECURITY RISK MA NAGEMENT   \\n \\n3 \\n \\n1. Executive summary  \\nThe c omplexity of information and communication technology ( ICT) and security risks is increasing \\nand the frequency of ICT and security -related incidents (including cyber incidents) is rising , together \\nwith their potential significant adverse impact  on financial institutions ’ operational functioning. \\nMoreover, due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions , ICT and security -relate d \\nincidents risk causing potential systemic impact s. The EBA has responded to this by detailing how \\nsupervisors should cover ICT and security risk s within supervision (EBA/GL/2017/05), by detailing \\nhow financial institutions should manage outsourcing (EBA/ GL/2019/02) and by describing the \\nexpectation s for ICT and security risk management for the financial institutions in these guidelines . \\nThese guidelines set out how financial institutions  should manage the ICT and security risk s that \\nthey are exposed to. In addition, this guidance aims to provide the financial institutions to which \\nthe guidelines apply  with a better understanding of supervisory expectations for the management \\nof ICT and security risk s. \\nThese guidelines integrate  and are built on the requirements set out in the ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures for operational and security risks of payment services ’ (hereafter ‘Guidelines on security \\nmeasures ’), which were published in December 2017 (EBA /GL/2017/17) and which have appl ied \\nsince January 2018 in fulfilment of the mandate in Article  95(3) of Directive  2015/2366/EU (PSD2) . \\nThose guidelines were addressed to payment service providers (PSPs ), and only applied to their \\npayment services ; however , they were  in fact relevant to a broader set of institutions. For that \\nreason, these guidelines have been formulated to be addressed to a broader range of financial \\ninstitutions  under the EBA ’s remit  (namely to credit institutions wh ich already fell within  the scope \\nof the guidelines  on security measures for their payment services , but for wh ich these guidelines \\nwill now apply for all activities) and to investment firms.  These guidelines continue to apply to PSPs \\nfor the payment services they provide ; they extend to other activities o f credit institutions and also \\napply to investment firms for all activities.  Collectively, the guidelines apply to financial institutions \\nas set out in paragraph  9 under the addressees section.  \\nThe term ‘ICT and security risk s’ addresses  the operational an d security risks mandate of Article  95 \\nof the r evised Payments Services Directive (PSD2 ). This term recognises that the operational risks \\nfor payment services refer predominantly to ICT and security risk s because of the electronic nature \\nof payment services  (over ICT systems).  For this reason, these guidelines refer to ‘ICT and security \\nrisk’ instead of ‘operational and security risk’ to avoid confusion with wider operational risk issues , \\nsuch as  conduct risk, legal risk and reputational risk. Furthe rmore, security risks may stem from \\ninadequate or failed internal processes or exter nal events , but ultimately it is their  impact on \\nsystems and data that is relevant. The definition of ‘ICT and security risk ’ is based on the definition \\nin the EBA Guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory \\nreview and evaluation process and supervisory stress testing (EBA /GL/2018/03) ; thus , it \\nencompasses data integrity risk but includes additional details to clarify that it covers the impact \\nderiving from security risks.', metadata={'source': 'guidelines/Final draft Guidelines on ICT and security risk management.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Furthermore , the guidelines in point  (b) \\ndo not apply to investment firms. The new Guidelines on ICT and security risk management  aim to \\naddress the European Commission request7 for guidelines for all institutions regarding their ICT \\nsecurity and governance. The aim is to ensure sound ICT and security management in the EU \\nfinancial sector and to ensure a level playing field for all institutions.  The new guidelines integrate \\nthe existing text of the ‘Guidelines on security measures ’ and broaden the scope of addressees, \\nnamely covering all activities for credit institutions and investment firms. Furthermore, the new \\nguidelines build on  the existing requirements in the ‘Guidelines on security measures ’ but are more \\nexplicit, clarifying in more detail how institutions can ensure adequate management of their ICT \\nand security.  \\nB. Policy objectives  \\nThe main objective of the guidelines is to establish harmonised requirements for ICT and security \\nacross PSPs (for payment services) and institutions (for credit institutions and investment firms , this \\nextends to all activities). In return, this is expected to contribute to better management of ris ks \\narising to market integrity, consumers and the viability of institutions and PSPs from ICT.  \\nOperationally, the guidelines aim to integrate all provisions on ICT and security management in a \\nsingle legal text for all financial institutions and for a wide r range of activities.  \\nC.

It requires the \\nestablishment of the financial institutions’ ICT strategy, which should be aligned with their overall \\nbusiness strategy. The guidelines also remind financial institutions  to ensure the effectiveness of \\nthe risk -mitigating measures, as defined by their risk management framework, when outsourcing \\nor using third party providers. This should be set out in contracts and service  level agreements. \\nNevertheless, financ ial institutions  should monitor and seek assurance of the level of compliance.  \\nSection  3.3 requires financial institution s to manage and mitigate  ICT and security risks through an \\nindependent and objective control function, appropriately segregated from IC T operations \\nprocesses and not responsible for any internal audit, and  an independent internal audit function.  It \\nrequires financial institutions  to maintain up dated  mapping  of their business functions, supporting \\nprocesses and information assets  and to classify them in terms of criticality, based on the \\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Based on this, financial institutions should assess \\nthe operational risks related to ICT and the security risk s that impact them  and should determine \\nwhat measures are required to mitigate the identified risks.  \\nSection  3.4 sets out requirements for information security to the extent that the information is held \\non ICT systems. This section defines requirements to implement effective information security \\nmeasures, including having an information security policy in place ; establishing, implementing and \\ntesting information security measures; and establishing a training programme for all staff  and \\ncontractors . \\nSection  3.5 specif ies high -level principles on how ICT operations should be managed, including \\nrequirements to improve , when possible , the efficiency of ICT operations ; implement logging and \\nmonitoring procedures for critical ICT operations ; maintain an up', metadata={'source': 'guidelines/Final draft Guidelines on ICT and security risk management.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
